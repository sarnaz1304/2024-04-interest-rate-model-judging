# [M-12] `Market.sol`, `RewardsController.sol`, `InstallmentsRouter.sol`, and `MarketETHRouter.sol` use Solmate's `SafeTransferLib`, which Allow Honeypot Attacks (Asset Loss)

## Summary

The `Market.sol`, `RewardsController.sol`, `InstallmentsRouter.sol`, and `MarketETHRouter.sol` contracts in the protocol use Solmate's `SafeTransferLib` for ERC20 token transfers. However, `SafeTransferLib` does not check the existence of the token contract before performing the transfer. This can lead to a honeypot attack where a malicious token contract is created that doesn't allow transfers to specific addresses, effectively trapping the tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
Many contracts use Solmate's `SafeTransferLib`, here are the contracts:

`Market.sol`:
```javascript
import { ERC4626, ERC20, SafeTransferLib } from "solmate/src/mixins/ERC4626.sol";
```
`RewardsController.sol`:
```javascript
import { SafeTransferLib } from "solmate/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol";
```
`InstallmentsRouter.sol`
```javascript
import { WETH, SafeTransferLib } from "solmate/src/tokens/WETH.sol";
```
`MarketETHRouter.sol`:
```javascript
import { WETH, SafeTransferLib } from "solmate/src/tokens/WETH.sol";
```

## Impact

 By using Solmate's `SafeTransferLib`, the protocol becomes vulnerable to honeypot attacks. An attacker can create a malicious contract that allows transfers to the protocol's contracts but prevents transfers out of them. The transferred tokens can then become permanently trapped in the protocol's contracts, leading to asset loss for users and potential disruption of the protocol's functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended to use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library instead of Solmate's `SafeTransferLib` for ERC20 token transfers. `SafeERC20` includes additional checks to ensure that the token contract exists and implements the necessary ERC20 functions before performing the transfer.
