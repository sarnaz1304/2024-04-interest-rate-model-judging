# Price feed's latest value can be easily manipulated

## Summary
Price feed's latest value can be easily manipulated because `PriceFeedPool.latestAnswer()` uses spot price from `pool.getReserves()`. This call can easily be manipulated by an attacker. A malicious user can get a flash loan and make a swap to artificially inflate the `reserve0` and the `reserve1` amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the comments to the function, the developer confirmed that he is aware of the risk of price manipulation, so he expects that this function will not affect the protocol, it will only be used for information purposes:
```solidity
  /// @dev Value should only be used for display purposes since pool reserves can be easily manipulated.
```
In practice, this is not the case - this function is used to determine the asset price in `Auditor.assetPrice()`. Asset price is widely used in many `Auditor.sol` contract functions in calculations. They are then used in the `Market.sol` contract to calculate `maxAssets`, `lendersAssets` and `seizeAssets` when liquidating positions, also manipulated value may affect `seize()` and `clearBadDebt()` functions.
## Impact
Price manipulations can lead to incorrect calculations and the incorrect operation of important functions of the protocol.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @notice Returns the price feed's latest value considering the pool's reserves (exchange rate).
  /// @dev Value should only be used for display purposes since pool reserves can be easily manipulated.
  function latestAnswer() external view returns (int256) {
    int256 mainPrice = basePriceFeed.latestAnswer();
    (uint256 reserve0, uint256 reserve1, ) = pool.getReserves();
    return
      int256(
        token1Based
          ? uint256(mainPrice).mulDivDown((reserve1 * baseUnit0) / reserve0, baseUnit1)
          : uint256(mainPrice).mulDivDown((reserve0 * baseUnit1) / reserve1, baseUnit0)
      );
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommended not to use the spot price to determine the price of the asset.
