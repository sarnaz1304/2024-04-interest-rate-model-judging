# Markets funds can be stolen by clearing bad debt for free by directly calling handleBadDebt(address) in auditor contract

## Summary
`Auditor` contract has `handleBadDebt(address)` function, its purpose is to clear all the bad debts associated with an account in all the linked markets during liquidation process. There are no checks in place that only allow `Market` contract to trigger this function. As a result, anybody can clear their bad debts both fixed and floating debts for free in all the markets by directly calling this function.
## Vulnerability Detail
**Here is how the developer assumed the handleBadDebt() will be called:**

[MARKET] liquidate()  --> [AUDITOR] handleBadDebt() --> [MARKET] clearBadDebt() --> will clear all the bad debts of an account

Since Market contract's `clearBadDebt()` has the access controls in place that only allow calls from auditor contract. But nothing stops the attacker to directly call `Auditor` contracts `handleBadDebt()` function which in turn calls `Market` contract's `clearBadDebt()` as a result the check is still bypassed.
```solidity
// 2024-04-interest-rate-model/protocol/contracts/Market.sol
619:  function clearBadDebt(address borrower) external {
620:     if (msg.sender != address(auditor)) revert NotAuditor();
            ...
            }
```
## Impact
Users can continue to steal market assets by clearing all the floating and fixed debt associated with them in undercollateralized positions for free and withdraw their rest of collateral balances without any restrictions, which breaks the whole purpose of `liquidate` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce Access controls on `handleBadDebt()` and only allow calls from `Market` contract
```diff
  function handleBadDebt(address account) external {
+ if (msg.sender != address(market)) revert NotMarket();
    uint256 memMarketMap = accountMarkets[account];
    uint256 marketMap = memMarketMap;
    for (uint256 i = 0; marketMap != 0; marketMap >>= 1) {
      if (marketMap & 1 != 0) {
        Market market = marketList[i];
        MarketData storage m = markets[market];
        uint256 assets = market.maxWithdraw(account);
        if (assets.mulDivDown(assetPrice(m.priceFeed), 10 ** m.decimals).mulWadDown(m.adjustFactor) > 0) return;
      }
      unchecked {
        ++i;
      }
    }

    marketMap = memMarketMap;
    for (uint256 i = 0; marketMap != 0; marketMap >>= 1) {
      if (marketMap & 1 != 0) marketList[i].clearBadDebt(account);
      unchecked {
        ++i;
      }
    }
  }

```
