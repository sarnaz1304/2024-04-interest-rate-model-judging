# Users can withdraw the full deposited amount by keeping full debt.

## Summary
Users can withdraw the full deposited amount by keeping full debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let’s assume, there are 5 markets i.e [market1,market2,market3,market4,market5] and those market’s index is 0,1,2,3,4 respectively.
 
2. Alice deposits 100e18 in market2.then Alice borrows 50e18(which is equal to 50e18 in market2) from market3.
 
3. See borrow function , this calls the auditor.checkborrow function , now see checkborrow function,currently alice’s marketMap = 0,
            marketMask = 1 << m.index = 1<<2(as market3 index is 2) = 4; as marketMap & marketMask i.e 0&4 = 0, so accountMarkets[alice] = marketMap | marketMask = 0| 4 = 4,  accountMarkets[alice] is set to 4.

4.  Now alice calls the withdraw function (market2 contract) which calls the auditor.checkshortfall function, now see checkShortfall function , here accountMarkets[account] & (1 << markets[market].index) i.e 4&(1<<2) = 4&2 = 0. As accountMarkets[account] & (1 << markets[market].index) = 0, so checkshortfall is bypassed .

5. As checkshortfall is bypassed, so alice withdraw the full 100e18 deposit amount from market2 by keeping 50e18 debt in market3. Now Alice has 0 collateral but 50e18 debt in the market3.

## Impact
