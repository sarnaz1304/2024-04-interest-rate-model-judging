# Incorrect previewed `totalFloatingBorrowAssets()` on liquidations due to not taking into account repaid maturities

## Summary

Liquidations repay debt from borrowed maturities and then borrowed floating shares. The repaid maturities will modify `floatingAssets` and possibly `floatingBackupBorrowed`, leading to a different `newDebt` calculated using the interest model floating rate.

## Vulnerability Detail

The amount of debt to repay is calculated on `Auditor::checkLiquidation()`, which gets the snapshot of the liquidatee on every market. 

The total debt in each market is previewed in `Market::previewDebt()`, which previews the debt corresponding to the floating borrowed shares by using the `totalFloatingBorrowAssets()` and calculates the ratio.

The issue lies in the fact that `totalFloatingBorrowAssets()` and `updateFloatingDebt()` calculate the interest rate based on, among other factors, `floatingAssets` and `floatingBackupBorrowed`, which are modified during the liquidation, more precisely when liquidating borrowed maturities.

When liquidating, initially the new floating debt is previewed using a set of parameters, but due to repaying borrowed maturities, when it gets to repaying floating shares, the parameters will be others and `totalFloatingBorrowAssets()` will return a different value than the previewed on `Auditor::checkLiquidation()`.

Add the following test to `Market.t.sol` and place `console.log()` of the previously mentioned parameters in `totalFloatingBorrowAssets()` and `updateFloatingDebt()`, confirming that repaying maturities will modify the variables, leading to different debt calculations.
The parameters before and after repaying the borrowed maturities are:

    )
  );
  
  vm.prank(BOB);
  market.deposit(50_000 ether, BOB);

  vm.startPrank(ALICE);

  uint256 maturity = FixedLib.INTERVAL * 3;

  // ALICE deposits and borrows DAI
  uint256 assets = 10_000 ether;
  ERC20 asset = market.asset();
  deal(address(asset), ALICE, assets);
  market.deposit(assets, ALICE);
  market.borrowAtMaturity(maturity, assets*50*50/100/100, type(uint256).max, ALICE, ALICE);
  (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = auditor.accountLiquidity(address(ALICE), Market(address(0)), 0);
  market.borrow((collateral - debt) * 8 / 10, ALICE, ALICE);
  
  vm.stopPrank();

  skip(maturity);

  // LIQUIDATION fails as transfer from is after withdrawing collateral
  deal(address(asset), address(market), 100_000 ether);
  address liquidator = makeAddr("liquidator");
  vm.startPrank(liquidator);
  asset.approve(address(market), type(uint256).max);
  market.liquidate(ALICE, type(uint256).max, market);
  vm.stopPrank();
}
```

## Impact

The health factor will be incorrect leading to less/more assets seized than supposed. The error depends on how much the parameters are affected by the liquidation of the borrowed maturities and the liquidatee having floating borrow shares. Given a mismatch, it may be possible for the seize available of an user to be overestimated, such that when withdrawing the collateral to the liquidator it would try to remove too much and revert.

## Recommendation

Call `updateFloatingDebt()` at the beginning of `Market::liquidate()` to ensure that the new debt corresponding to the interest rate model will be the same throughout the liquidation.
