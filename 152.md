# Balances of rebasing tokens aren't properly tracked

## Summary

Rebasing tokens are tokens where `balanceOf()` returns larger amounts over time, due to the addition of interest to each account, or due to airdrops.

## Vulnerability Detail

Exactly Protocol doesn't properly track balance changes while rebasing tokens are in the borrower's account.

## Impact

The lender will miss out on gains that should have accrued to them while the asset was lent out. While market-based price corrections may be able to handle interest that is accrued to everyone, market approaches won't work when only subsets of token addresses are given rewards, e.g. an airdrop based on a snapshot of activity that happened prior to the token being lent.
