# Lack of minimum values parameters for vesting in EscrowEXA

## Summary
The vest function in escrow contract does provide users the ability to add max params but it does not give users the 
ability to propose the acceptable min values of those parameters which can make some people to lose value when
they are giving the max threshold and not the minimum acceptable values because the contract itself does not support it.

## Vulnerability Detail


```solidity
  function vest(uint128 amount, address to, uint256 maxRatio, uint256 maxPeriod) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
    assert(amount != 0);
    if (reserveRatio > maxRatio || vestingPeriod > maxPeriod) revert Disagreement();

  // snip
  }
```
The protocol checks for upper bounds tolerance of user but it does not provide lower bound tolerance to users which might lead to users losing the value of their tokens.

## Impact
loss of token values for users if undesired lower bounds occur for their token vesting period

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow users to add minReserveRatio and minPeriod too .and let them decide if they want to use max limits or min limits provided by them.
