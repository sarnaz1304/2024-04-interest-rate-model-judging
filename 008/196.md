# `TotalAssets` miscalculation  Leads to Distorted Share Values and Unfair MEV Opportunities

## Summary
- The `totalAssets` function miscalculates the real total assets  by excluding **matured** loans with penalties before the current timestamp. This oversight undervalues shares and disrupts accurate calculations for withdrawals, liquidations, and other share-based transactions.

## Vulnerability Details

### Affected Function:
- **Function**: `totalAssets`
- **Contract**: Market.sol ([totalAssets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L545))

 
- The `totalAssets` function in the `Market` contract calculates the total value of all assets under the contract's control. It is used to determine how much each participant's `shares` are worth for operations such as depositing, withdrawing, and redeeming... it loops through active Fixed loan pools calculating their contributions since last accrual until either present time or full term .
```js
   function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
    unchecked {
      uint256 backupEarnings = 0;

      uint256 latestMaturity = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % FixedLib.INTERVAL);
      uint256 maxMaturity = latestMaturity + maxFuturePools * FixedLib.INTERVAL;

      for (uint256 maturity = latestMaturity; maturity <= maxMaturity; maturity += FixedLib.INTERVAL) {
        FixedLib.Pool storage pool = fixedPools[maturity];
        uint256 lastAccrual = pool.lastAccrual;

        if (maturity > lastAccrual) {
          backupEarnings += block.timestamp < maturity
            ? pool.unassignedEarnings.mulDivDown(block.timestamp - lastAccrual, maturity - lastAccrual)
            : pool.unassignedEarnings;
        }
      }
    // ....
    }
  }
```
- notice that the return value of this function may return incorrect value (less then actual totalAssets) which will lead to incorrect minting or burning of shares , the  vulnerability arises from   ***Maturity Exclusion Issue***:
 - The totalAssets function calculates the total value starting from the current block timestamp, using this as a baseline to determine which fixed-term loan pools to include in its earnings calculations:
```js
 uint256 latestMaturity = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % FixedLib.INTERVAL);
```
 - It then sets a range up to `maxFuturePools * FixedLib.INTERVAL`, effectively creating a window that only includes maturities happening at or after the current time.
 ```js 
uint256 maxMaturity = latestMaturity + maxFuturePools * FixedLib.INTERVAL;
```
- Any fixed-term pools that have ***matured*** before ***latestMaturity*** are not considered, meaning ***unassignedEarnings*** and ***penalties***  intended for earnings accumulation and  from past-due maturities are omitted. and doesn't contribute to `backupEarnings`.
```js 
for (uint256 maturity = latestMaturity; maturity <= maxMaturity; maturity += FixedLib.INTERVAL) {
    // ... calculation of backupEarnings for included maturities ...
}
```

- These omissions lead to an undervaluation of total asset figures and consequently, share values at specific times.

- This issue creates unfair MEV opportunities, which allow extracting value (that's meant to be for depositors) from the protocol immediately.

An attacker (or a borrower who has a debt with penalty) can exploit this issue through a sequence of actions:

1. Observe a pending **matured** repayment transaction (involving penalty fees).
2. Deposit funds into the protocol before this transaction is processed, acquiring shares at an undervalued rate due to current calculation logic flaws.
3. Redeem their shares after unassigned earnings and penalty fees have been applied but before they are reflected in `Total Assets`, thus receiving more than their fair value due to inflated supply calculations missing contributions from pre-timestamp maturities' accumulated fines.

> **Note:** Penalty fees are not distributed immediately but through the earnings accumulator; thus, the attacker may need to wait some time to extract more value, but the unassigned earnings still give them instant value. 

**Example**:
 - Consider a simplified example illustrating the impact of this vulnerability:

- Initially, `totalAssets` in the protocol is 1100 units. User A's shareholding represents 1000 units.
  
- An attacker observes a borrower about to repay with penalties and quickly deposits `1000`, minting shares for themselves. The attacker now holds approximately `909.09` shares (`1000 * (attacker deposit) / (initial total assets)`).
 - now `totalAssets = 2200`
- After the repayment transaction occurs with additional unassigned earnings of `100` units , `totalAssets` increases to `2200`.

- The attacker  cash out and redeems their shares at an inflated value due to previously undervalued total assets—receiving roughly `1047.618` units (`(attackerShares) * (new total assets after penalty payment) / (new total supply)`).

Meanwhile:

- When User` A `goes on to redeem their original holdings after all these events have unfolded, they receive only around `1152.38` units—a lesser value than expected because part of what should have been distributed as increased asset valuation has already been siphoned off by the attacker.

- Furthermore, users withdrawing after such discrepancies in `totalAssets` calculations will receive less value for their shares.

## Tool Used for Identification
Manual Review

## Impact
- The incorrect calculation of `totalAssets` affects all share value computations, distorting withdrawals, liquidations, and other share-based operations.
- This flaw opens the door for unfair MEV strategies that can extract undue value from the protocol immediately.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 
To address the miscalculation in `totalAssets`, a two-step approach is recommended:

1. **Capture Minimum Maturity**: Implement storage of the earliest maturity date within the contract. Each time a user borrows at maturity, compare it against this stored minimum; if it's earlier, update to this new date.

2. **Adjust Total Assets Calculation**: Modify the `totalAssets` function to start calculations from this lowest recorded maturity, ensuring that unassigned earnings from all past and future maturities are accurately included in total asset figures.
