# Double Accounting Of EXA Reserves While Canceling a Vest

## Summary

When a user cancels his vest ,the EXA he put up as reserves is returned back , but this is transfer of EXA reserves is accounted twice and thus user receives twice the reserves he put up.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's break down the cancel function ->

1.) A user wants to cancel his vest , calls `cancel()` with the streamIds for his vests.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/periphery/EscrowedEXA.sol#L133

2.) It is made sure the recipient of the vest is the msg.sender

3.) `streamReserves` are calculated adding up all the reserves for the streamIds (summing up all the reserve amounts for the user's vests).

4.) Then the sablier's cancel function is called , that function invokes a callback function i.e. `onStreamCanceled()`

5.) That function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/periphery/EscrowedEXA.sol#L188-L192 

calls `returnReserves()` at L192 and that function -> 

```solidity=
function returnReserve(uint256 streamId, address recipient) internal {
    uint256 reserve = reserves[streamId];
    delete reserves[streamId];
    exa.safeTransfer(recipient, reserve);
  }
```

We can see that the streamId's reserve is returned/transferred here.

6.) Therefore in the for loop at L135 , all the reserves associated with the streamIds would be returned to the recipient.

7.) But , at L147 here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/periphery/EscrowedEXA.sol#L147 we again transfer the `streamReserves` (summation of all reserves) to the recipients , leading to recipient receiving twice the reserves he should have.


## Impact

The recipient would always receive twice the number of reserves he should have received due to double accounting.

## Recommendation

Don't perform the transfer of reserves at L147
