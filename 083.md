# Fixed pool debt may not be repaid because maturity is in not ready state.

## Summary
Fixed pool debt may not be allowed to be repaid because maturity is in not ready state.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Market::repayAtMaturity(), borrowers can repay their fixed pool debts, no matter it's matured or not. The vulnerability is that contract will check whether the maturity is valid/maturity or not. If the pool state is in `INVALID` or `NOT_READY`, borrowers cannot repay debts. 

```c
  function repayAtMaturity(
    uint256 maturity,
    uint256 positionAssets,
    uint256 maxAssets,
    address borrower
  ) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 actualRepayAssets) {
    // reverts on failure
    FixedLib.checkPoolState(maturity, maxFuturePools, FixedLib.State.VALID, FixedLib.State.MATURED);

    actualRepayAssets = noTransferRepayAtMaturity(maturity, positionAssets, maxAssets, borrower, true);
    emitMarketUpdate();

    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), actualRepayAssets);
  }
```
Considering that the maxFuturePools can be set again, and the value can be decreased. If the `maxFuturePools` is decreased, some fix rated pools might change from `VALID` to `NOT_READY`. This will cause some borrow positions cannot be repaid. Meanwhile, these borrow positions can be liquidated. This is quite unfair for the borrowers. Borrowers have to take some unexpected risks.

```c
  /// @notice Sets the protocol's max future pools for fixed borrowing and lending.
  /// @dev If value is decreased, VALID maturities will become NOT_READY.
  /// @param futurePools number of pools to be active at the same time.
  function setMaxFuturePools(uint8 futurePools) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    maxFuturePools = futurePools;
    emit MaxFuturePoolsSet(futurePools);
  }
```

## Impact
Some borrow position cannot be repaid if `maxFuturePools` decreases. Borrowers have to take more risks than they expect.

## Recommendation
Allow borrowers to repay their debt which exist in one `NOT-READY` pool.
