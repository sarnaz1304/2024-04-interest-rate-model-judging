# `refund` lacks slippage

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`Market.refund` method takes in borrowShares which are converted to `assets` through `noTransferRefund` which calls `previewRefund`.   
In `previewRefund`, the output is based on dynamic variables - totalFloatingBorrowAssets and totalFloatingBorrowShares.  
```solidity
  function previewRefund(uint256 shares) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 supply = totalFloatingBorrowShares; // volatile


    return supply == 0 ? shares : shares.mulDivUp(totalFloatingBorrowAssets(), supply); // also volatile
  }
```
These 2 variables can change greatly and unexpectedly in high-activity times or if substantial time passes between transaction submission-execution (e.g low gas price selected) meaning the output is also prone to changes. The final output of noTransferRefund is afterwards passed to the `refund` method as `assets` and invokes `safeTransferFrom` 
```solidity
    (assets, actualShares) = noTransferRefund(borrowShares, borrower);
    emitMarketUpdate();
    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
```
No slippage means there is a risk of user paying more than anticipated and more than they are willing to spend.
## Impact
Unexpected behaviour
## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function refund(
    uint256 borrowShares,
    address borrower
  ) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 assets, uint256 actualShares) {
    (assets, actualShares) = noTransferRefund(borrowShares, borrower); // asset output is not tried against maxAssets willing to be repaid
    emitMarketUpdate();
    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets); 
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add input `maxAssets` willing to be repaid similar to [repayAtMaturity ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L445) method
