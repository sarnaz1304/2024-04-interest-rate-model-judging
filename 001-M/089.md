# The `latestAnswer()` is deprecated and lacks sufficient validation, thus it can return stale prices

## Summary

The protocol utilizes the deprecated Chainlink interface `latestAnswer()` to fetch prices, which may return outdated prices. This can lead to inaccuracies in data calculations, such as `seizeAssets`, which rely on these potentially stale prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `Auditor.calculateSeize()` function, the protocol invokes `assetPrice()` to retrieve the price of the token, and then uses this price to calculate `seizeAssets`. 
```solidity
  function calculateSeize(
    Market repayMarket,
    Market seizeMarket,
    address borrower,
    uint256 actualRepayAssets
  ) external view returns (uint256 lendersAssets, uint256 seizeAssets) {
    LiquidationIncentive memory memIncentive = liquidationIncentive;
    lendersAssets = actualRepayAssets.mulWadDown(memIncentive.lenders);

    // read prices for borrowed and collateral markets
    uint256 priceBorrowed = assetPrice(markets[repayMarket].priceFeed);
    uint256 priceCollateral = assetPrice(markets[seizeMarket].priceFeed);
    uint256 baseAmount = actualRepayAssets.mulDivUp(priceBorrowed, 10 ** markets[repayMarket].decimals);

    seizeAssets = Math.min(
      baseAmount.mulDivUp(10 ** markets[seizeMarket].decimals, priceCollateral).mulWadUp(
        1e18 + memIncentive.liquidator + memIncentive.lenders
      ),
      seizeMarket.maxWithdraw(borrower)
    );
  }

```

Let's take a closer look at the `assetPrice()` function. Within this function, the protocol calls `priceFeed.latestAnswer()` from Chainlink to obtain the price. 
```solidity
  function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    return uint256(price) * baseFactor;
  }

```

However, `latestAnswer()` is a deprecated function in [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer), and there is no check for whether the return value is stale data. The official documentation explicitly states not to use this function.
```solidity

latestAnswer:
THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION.

```

## Impact
The staleness of the Chainlink return values will lead to wrong calculation of the collateral price and other unexpected behavior.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `latestRoundData()` function should be used instead of the deprecated `latestAnswer` function and add sufficient checks to ensure that the price is not stale.
