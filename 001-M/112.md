# Chainlink's `latestAnswer` is deprecated

## Summary

According to Chainlink's official docs, the function `latestAnswer` is deprecated, and the docs specifically warns against the usage of said function. 

Because the Chainlink protocol is considered trusted, the warn against said function implies a removal of support in the future, and their docs must be followed for correct integration.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the [official Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestanswer), the function `latestAnswer()` has been marked as deprecated, and the official docs explicitly warns against using such function.

If the function ends up being completely scrapped, then the protocol will continue operating on the old price, which will allow borrows against a much higher collateral price than expected.

## Impact

Chainlink price feed endpoint may stop returning values altogether
