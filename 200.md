# staticcall to wrapper isn't checked to ensure it succeeds

## Summary
returned boolean value isn't checked.
## Vulnerability Detail
staticcall very much like call returns 2 values, 1 is a `bool` which is true on success and the other is `bytes` which is the data

```solidity
   (, bytes memory data) = address(wrapper).staticcall(abi.encodeWithSelector(conversionSelector, baseUnit));

```

Above in PriceFeedWrapper.latestAnswer(), the returned bool isn't checked to ensure the staticcall succeeds.
## Impact

staticcall to wrapper's `conversionSelector` can silently fail.
