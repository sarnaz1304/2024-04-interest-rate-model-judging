# Several estimations round against the protocol

## Summary
When designing a lending/borrowing protocol, it is important to ensure that all collateral and debt calculations round in favor of the protocol. There are a couple areas in this codebase that round in favor of the user, not the protocol. This can lead to share manipulation or bad debt if the shortfall calculations are manipulated due to improper rounding.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Auditor.sol` contract allows a user to enter or exit a market. Entering a market adds the users collateral (and debt) balances to the calculation regarding their account health. In order for a user to exit a market, the Auditor contract ensures that the user's health factor WILL NOT fall to unhealthy levels as a result of the withdrawal of collateral.

However, the liquidity check rounds in favor of the user, improperly underestimating the increase in amount of debt (inverse of increase in collateral.

```solidity
        if (market == marketToSimulate) {
          // calculate the effects of redeeming markets
          // (having less collateral is the same as having more debt for this calculation)
          if (withdrawAmount != 0) {
            sumDebtPlusEffects += withdrawAmount.mulDivDown(vars.price, baseUnit).mulWadDown(adjustFactor);
          }
```

In this code, the Auditor contract is attempting to estimate how the user's health would change as a result of withdrawing `withdrawAmount` of collateral. The contract simplifies the calculation by simply adding the equivalent amount of debt instead of reducing the amount of collateral.

As can be seen above, the debt calculation used `mulDivDown()`, which rounds in favor of the user at the risk to the protocol. All debt calculations should ROUND UP and all collateral calculations should ROUND DOWN.

We have seen numerous exploits pertaining to improper rounding directions.

## Impact
- Potential accumulation of bad debt due to improper shortfall calculation.
