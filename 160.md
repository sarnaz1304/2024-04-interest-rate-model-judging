# Lack of EIP-712 compliance will result in a DOS of the `claim()` function having the `permitSender` modifier

## Summary

According to [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-encodedata):

> The array values are encoded as the keccak256 hash of the concatenated encodeData of their contents (i.e. the encoding of SomeType[5] is identical to that of a struct containing five members of type SomeType).

However, the signature computed to recover `recoveredAddress` in `modifier permitSender()` in `RewardsController` doesn't respect the standard, meaning that a user having signed their message according to the EIP712 standard won't be able to use the `claim()` function at [RewardsController.sol#L168](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/RewardsController.sol#L168)

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue is that the direct array of addresses is passed at [RewardsController.sol#L757](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/RewardsController.sol#L757):

```js
File: RewardsController.sol
747:       address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(
748:         keccak256(
749:           abi.encodePacked(
750:             "\x19\x01",
751:             DOMAIN_SEPARATOR(),
752:             keccak256(
753:               abi.encode(
754:                 keccak256("ClaimPermit(address owner,address spender,address[] assets,uint256 deadline)"),
755:                 permit.owner,
756:                 msg.sender,
757:                 permit.assets,   //<---------- @audit-issue this isn't EIP712 compliant
758:                 nonces[permit.owner]++,
759:                 permit.deadline
760:               )
```

Standard and compliant signatures that will be proposed to be signed to the users won't be matching with this signature passed to `ecrecover`, as `permit.assets` is of type `address[]`, and as stated in <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-encodedata> :
> The array values are encoded as the keccak256 hash of the concatenated encodeData of their contents

It means that `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(permit.assets))` is what's expected here, not a direct use of `permit.assets`

Several code examples exist out there to help in knowing how to hash arrays according to EIP712, like:

- OpenSea's [Seaport's example with offerHashes and considerationHashes](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/a62c2f8f484784735025d7b03ccb37865bc39e5a/reference/lib/ReferenceGettersAndDerivers.sol#L130-L131) which are arrays of structs, so are a bit more complicated.
- The answer to "Signing an array with `eth_signTypedData_v4`" here: <https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/130843>

## Impact

DOS on the `claim()` function protected by `permitSender(permit)` at [RewardsController.sol#L165-L168](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/RewardsController.sol#L165-L168)

It could be argued that the user could be provided by the protocol with a non-ERC712-compliant message to sign, as to mitigate this issue. However, be aware that this will look to the user like some non-human-readable bytestrings and that they'll need to blinding accept to sign such a message to use this specific feature from this specific protocol. Only by respecting the EIP712-standard will the encoded-datas be shown through wallets as human-readable text.

Given the degraded functionality and high likelihood of non-use from users (very unlikely to expect them to keep blindly signing messages just so that they'd be `ecrecover`-able on this specific protocol), this is rated as Medium Severity.

## Recommendation

Change the code at [RewardsController.sol#L757](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/RewardsController.sol#L757):

```diff

749:           abi.encodePacked(
750:             "\x19\x01",
751:             DOMAIN_SEPARATOR(),
752:             keccak256(
753:               abi.encode(
754:                 keccak256("ClaimPermit(address owner,address spender,address[] assets,uint256 deadline)"),
755:                 permit.owner,
756:                 msg.sender,
- 757:                 permit.assets,
+ 757:                 keccak256(abi.encodePacked(permit.assets)),
758:                 nonces[permit.owner]++,
