# The calculation of `released` in `config` function of `RewardsController` is wrong

## Summary
The calculation of `released` in `config` function of `RewardsController` is wrong
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider this case:
1. `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` call `config` first time. At this time:
```solidity
rewardData.lastConfig = uint32(block.timestamp);  // time of calling config
```
2. The time is between `rewardData.start` and `rewardData.end`,  `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` call `config` again. 
3. The calculation of `released` is as follows:
```solidity
            released =
              rewardData.lastConfigReleased + rewardData.releaseRate * (block.timestamp - rewardData.lastConfig);
```
`rewardData.lastConfig` is the time of last config, but the distribution of rewards starts at `rewardData.start`. These two times (lastConfig and start) should be different. So the `released` will be larger than the actual amount.
## Impact
`config` function is called by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. In some case , `config` will be reverted because the `released` is larger than actual amount. In other case, the `releaseRate` will be smaller leading to the stuck of some undistributed rewards.

## Recommendation
```diff
-   released =
-              rewardData.lastConfigReleased + rewardData.releaseRate * (block.timestamp - rewardData.lastConfig);
+   released =
+              rewardData.lastConfigReleased + rewardData.releaseRate * (block.timestamp - rewardData.start);
