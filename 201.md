# FixedLib#setMaturity: After 18 years, maturity encoding will overflow

## Summary
The `encoding` variable which is a 256 bit storage used to store maturities, can overflow as 1 bit can be shifted every 4 weeks.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol stores maturity dates in encoded bits. The last 32 bits store the actual date(baseMaturity), while the bits before specify how long(in intervals of four weeks) from the baseMaturity that a position was open.

```solidity
  function setMaturity(uint256 encoded, uint256 maturity) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // initialize the maturity with also the 1st bit on the 33th position set
    if (encoded == 0) return maturity | (1 << 32);

    uint256 baseMaturity = encoded & ((1 << 32) - 1);
    if (maturity < baseMaturity) {
      // if the new maturity is lower than the base, set it as the new base
      // wipe clean the last 32 bits, shift the amount of `INTERVAL` and set the new value with the 33rd bit set
      uint256 range = (baseMaturity - maturity) / INTERVAL;
      if (encoded >> (256 - range) != 0) revert MaturityOverflow();
      encoded = ((encoded >> 32) << (32 + range));
      return maturity | encoded | (1 << 32);
    } else {
      uint256 range = (maturity - baseMaturity) / INTERVAL;
      if (range > 223) revert MaturityOverflow();
      return encoded | (1 << (32 + range));//@audit-info after 18 years, it will overflow
    }
  }
```

After `INTERVAL` period, which is a 4 week period, each bit in the encoding(apart from the last 32 bits) can be shifted one position to the left.

Since `encoded` has 256 bits(cos it u=is uint256), a bit in the encoding can be shifted 256-32 times before the maturity encoding overflows.
This translates to 224\*4 weeks=17.23years.

- After this period, subsequent operations won't be able to store new maturity dates as they will always get shifted out of the 256 bits size allotted for the `encoding` variable.
- the significantly large interest to be paid on a borrow that was made 17.23 years ago, would be forgiven.

## Impact
Subsequent operations won't be able to store new maturity dates as they will always get shifted out of the 256 bits size allotted for the `encoding` variable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If shifting causes overflow of the `encoding` variable, a new `encoding` variable should be used to store newer vslues, but the previous encoding should not be forgotten. They can be stored in an array.
