# Miscalculation of already released rewards in the `RewardsController.config()` function

## Summary
Read section below

## Vulnerability Detail
The `RewardsController.config()` function is employed to initiate or modify the reward distribution for designated markets and rewards. If the reward distribution is still ongoing, the function begins by calculating the amount of reward that has already been released and the time elapsed since the start of the distribution. This information is crucial for determining the updated `releaseRate` for the configuration.

```solidity=
if (block.timestamp < end) {
      uint256 released = 0;
      uint256 elapsed = 0;
      if (block.timestamp > start) {
        released =
          rewardData.lastConfigReleased +
          rewardData.releaseRate * (block.timestamp - rewardData.lastConfig); /// [$audit-med] lastConfig can be less than start 

        elapsed = block.timestamp - start;
        if (configs[i].totalDistribution <= released || configs[i].distributionPeriod <= elapsed) {
          revert InvalidConfig();
        }
        rewardData.lastConfigReleased = released;
      }

      rewardData.releaseRate =
        (configs[i].totalDistribution - released) /
        (configs[i].distributionPeriod - elapsed);
```

An issue arises in the calculation of `released` when the function assumes the current `releaseRate` will be applied to the interval `[rewardData.lastConfig, block.timestamp]`, where `rewardData.lastConfig` marks the most recent update to the reward distribution. However, if `rewardData.lastConfig < rewardData.start`, this assumption leads to an error because the actual duration of the reward distribution is `block.timestamp - rewardData.start` seconds, which is less than `block.timestamp - rewardData.lastConfig`.

## Impact
The calculated amount of the `released` reward is larger than expected, which leads to a lower `rewardData.releaseRate`. As a consequence, some rewards may not be distributed to users and could be lost within the contracts.

## Recommendation
Consider adjusting the calculation for `released` to: 
```solidity=
released =
  rewardData.lastConfigReleased +
  rewardData.releaseRate *
    (block.timestamp - Math.max(rewardData.lastConfig, start));
```
