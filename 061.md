# Users who borrow funds may find themselves unable to fully repay their debt, thus perpetually remaining in debt.

## Summary
Users who borrow funds may find themselves unable to fully repay their debt, thus perpetually remaining in debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
User A deposits 50_000 ether;
user A borrows 5_000 ether;
after 10 days ;
User  tries to pay the exact amount owed (debt + interest incured);
User A is unable to do so as function reverts;
User A can only pay a maximum of 5_000 ether any other payment would revert;
user A will always be in debt as the number of days increases and unable to pay..

## Impact
The inability to fully repay borrowed funds can trap users in a cycle of debt,

### POC
```solidity
function testOperationsWithStEthAsset() external {
    MockStETH stETH = new MockStETH(1090725952265553962);
    Market marketStETH = Market(address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(new Market(stETH, auditor)), "")));
    marketStETH.initialize(
      "",
      3,
      1e18,
      InterestRateModel(address(irm)),
      0.02e18 / uint256(1 days),
      1e17,
      0,
      0.0046e18,
      0.42e18
    );
    PriceFeedWrapper priceFeedWrapper = new PriceFeedWrapper(
      new MockPriceFeed(18, 0.99e18),
      address(stETH),
      MockStETH.getPooledEthByShares.selector,
      1e18
    );
    auditor.enableMarket(marketStETH, priceFeedWrapper, 0.8e18);

    stETH.mint(address(this), 50_000 ether);
    stETH.approve(address(marketStETH), type(uint256).max);

    assertEq(auditor.assetPrice(priceFeedWrapper), 1079818692742898422);

    marketStETH.deposit(50_000 ether, address(this));
    marketStETH.borrow(5_000 ether, address(this), address(this));
    vm.warp(10 days);
    marketStETH.repay(marketStETH.previewDebt(address(this)), address(this)); // reverts unable to pay
    // assertEq(marketStETH.previewDebt(address(this)), 0);
  
    
  }
  ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 implement mechanisms to allow for full repayment of loans (debts + interest incured)
