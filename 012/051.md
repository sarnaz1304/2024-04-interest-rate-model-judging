# esEXA transfer restriction bypassed through vest()/cancel()

## Summary
esEXA is not transferrable by anyone without the `TRANSFERRER_ROLE`. However, this restriction/invariant is easily bypassed through simple vesting and canceling to an arbitrary recipient. This can be done atomically to essentially perform an esEXA transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
Any user can burn their esEXA to set up a vesting schedule for an arbitrary recipient. Then the recipient can cancel the vesting stream, receiving esEXA tokens through minting. This operation emulates a transfer.

```solidity
  function vest(uint128 amount, address to, uint256 maxRatio, uint256 maxPeriod) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
    ...
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);
```

```solidity
  function cancel(uint256[] memory streamIds) external returns (uint256 streamsReserves) {
    ...
    assert(msg.sender == sablier.getRecipient(streamId));
    ...
    _mint(msg.sender, refundableAmount);
    ...
  }
```

## Impact
- Break of transfer restriction/invariant

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Cancelling should return the burned esEXA (and also the EXA reserve) to the `msg.sender` that set up the vesting schedule, not the vesting recipient.
