# Pool state is not checked in totalAssets()

## Summary

In function `totalAssets`, all the property of the all pools at the time will be accounted for, even if the pool is of an impermissible type.

## Vulnerability Detail

In market.sol, `totalAssets` (used in ERC4626) counts ALL pools without checking pool status:

    function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
      unchecked {
        uint256 backupEarnings = 0;

        uint256 latestMaturity = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % FixedLib.INTERVAL); 
        uint256 maxMaturity = latestMaturity + maxFuturePools * FixedLib.INTERVAL;

        for (uint256 maturity = latestMaturity; maturity <= maxMaturity; maturity += FixedLib.INTERVAL) {
          FixedLib.Pool storage pool = fixedPools[maturity];
          uint256 lastAccrual = pool.lastAccrual;

          if (maturity > lastAccrual) {
            backupEarnings += block.timestamp < maturity 
              ? pool.unassignedEarnings.mulDivDown(block.timestamp - lastAccrual, maturity - lastAccrual)
              : pool.unassignedEarnings;
          }
        }

      return
        floatingAssets +
        backupEarnings +
        accumulatedEarnings() +
        (totalFloatingBorrowAssets() - floatingDebt).mulWadDown(1e18 - treasuryFeeRate);
    }
  }

But there are five possible states for a pool:

  enum State {
    NONE,
    INVALID,
    MATURED,
    VALID,
    NOT_READY
  }

When admin calls `setMaxFuturePools` to set a decreased value, VALID maturities will become `NOT_READY`. Since users are only allowed to interact with pools marked as `MATURED` or `VALID`, property in `NOT_READY` pools should not be counted in `totalAssets()`.

  /// @notice Sets the protocol's max future pools for fixed borrowing and lending.
  /// @dev If value is decreased, VALID maturities will become NOT_READY.
  /// @param futurePools number of pools to be active at the same time.
  function setMaxFuturePools(uint8 futurePools) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    maxFuturePools = futurePools;
    emit MaxFuturePoolsSet(futurePools);
  }

## Impact

totalAssets() may overestimate pool's avaliable assets. For future integrations, if admin wants to make certain pools invalid, assets in those pools will be counted in `totalAssets`, even if users can't interact with them.

## Recommendation

check pool state in function `totalAssets()` to ensure that only `MATURED` and `VALID` pools are counted in.
