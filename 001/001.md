# Precision loss in treasury fee and floating assets calculations due to the priority of division over multiplication

## Summary
Less accurate treasury fee and floating assets calculations due to the precision loss occur inside the `updateFloatingDebt()` function of the market.
## Vulnerability Detail
Solidity rounds down the result of an integer division, and because of that, it is always recommended to multiply before 
dividing to avoid that precision loss. In the case of a prior division over multiplication, the final result may face serious precision loss
as the first answer would face truncated precision and then multiplied to another integer.
The problem arises in the market's `updateFloatingDebt()` part. This function is responsible for updating the floating pool borrows' variables. 
If we look deeply at this function, we can see the floating assets and treasury calculation procedure is presented as:

```Solidity
    function updateFloatingDebt() internal returns (uint256 treasuryFee) {
      uint256 memFloatingDebt = floatingDebt;
      uint256 memFloatingAssets = floatingAssets;
      uint256 utilization = floatingUtilization(memFloatingAssets, memFloatingDebt);
      uint256 newDebt = memFloatingDebt.mulWadDown(
        interestRateModel
          .floatingRate(utilization, globalUtilization(memFloatingAssets, memFloatingDebt, floatingBackupBorrowed))
          .mulDivDown(block.timestamp - lastFloatingDebtUpdate, 365 days)
      );

      memFloatingDebt += newDebt;
      treasuryFee = newDebt.mulWadDown(treasuryFeeRate); // Precision loss occurs here
      floatingAssets = memFloatingAssets + newDebt - treasuryFee;
      floatingDebt = memFloatingDebt;
      lastFloatingDebtUpdate = uint32(block.timestamp);
      emit FloatingDebtUpdate(block.timestamp, utilization);
    }
```
we can see there is a hidden division before multiplication in the calculation of the `treasuryFee` that rounds down the whole expression. This variable is
calculated as the multiplication of `newDebt` and `treasuryFeeRate`. But the `newDebt` variable itself has a division over 365 days in seconds.

$$ treasuryFee = \frac{floatingRate \times \Delta t}{365\ days} $$

The more accurate implementation would be dividing the `365 days` at the final step and after all the multiplications.
This is bad as the precision loss can be significant, which leads to the pool calculating less `treasuryFee` than actual.
Also, it is better to mention that some protocols implement this method to have an integer part of the division (usually in time-related situations).
But here we can clearly see that this pattern is used in the calculation of `treasuryFee` at which the precision matters.

At the Proof of Concept part, we can check this behavior precisely.
You can run this code to see the difference between the results:

```Solidity
    function test_precissionLoss() public {

        uint256 memFloatingDebt = floatingDebt;
        uint256 memFloatingAssets = floatingAssets;
        uint256 utilization = floatingUtilization(memFloatingAssets, memFloatingDebt);
        uint256 newDebt = memFloatingDebt.mulWadDown(
          interestRateModel
            .floatingRate(utilization, globalUtilization(memFloatingAssets, memFloatingDebt, floatingBackupBorrowed))
            .mulDivDown(block.timestamp - lastFloatingDebtUpdate, 365 days)
        );

        uint256 treasuryFee = newDebt.mulWadDown(treasuryFeeRate);
        uint256 accurateTreasuryFee = mulDivDown(mulWadDown(mulWadDown(memFloatingDebt,
            floatingRate), (block.timestamp - lastFloatingDebtUpdate)), treasuryFeeRate, 365 days);
        
        console.log("Current Implementation ", treasuryFee);
        console.log("Actual Implementation ", accurateTreasuryFee);
    }
```

The result would be: (for these variables: 
`floatingDebt = 250 ether`, 
`floatingAssets = 120 ether`,
`floatingRate = 0.08 ether`,
`block.timestamp - lastFloatingDebtUpdate = 3600 seconds`)

```Solidity
     Current Implementation  1086943606671740233
     Actual Implementation   1086943607305936073
```
Thus, we can see that the actual implementation produces less fee amount than the precise method.

## Impact
Less treasury fee and floating assets as a result of precision loss.

## Recommendation
Consider modifying the treasury fee calculation to prevent such precision loss and prioritize multiplication over division.
