# Attacker can force a user to enter a market

## Summary



## Vulnerability Detail

* Whenever a user borrows (even a zero borrow) they are entered into the market
* There's no check on `borrow()` to verify that the borrow amount isn't zero. 
* Since borrowing a zero amount doesn't require any allowance, anybody can call `borrow()` with zero amount using any receiver as `borrower`
* This leads to the fact that anybody can force anybody to enter into any market

Consider the following scenario:
* Bob has assets in the USDC, and DAI market
* They approved Alice to borrow on their behalf on the ETH market
* They entered the USDC market, but not the DAI market
* Alice now wants to use Bob's DAI collateral to take a loan, so she forces him to enter the market with a zero-borrow
* Alice took a loan using collateral she wasn't supposed to use according to the protocol's design, causing a loss of assets to Bob


## Impact
Users are forced to enter market and use their assets as collateral.
This allows users who're approved to borrow on other markets to borrow on their behalf using assets they didn't intend to use as collateral.


## Code Snippet
No zero check here:

PoC:
Add the following to `protocol/test/Market.t.sol`

`import { console2} from  "forge-std/console2.sol";`
```solidity
  function testForceEnter_POC() external {
    address bob = address(0xbab);
    uint marketsBefore = auditor.accountMarkets(bob);
    market.borrow(0, address(this), bob);
    uint marketsAfter = auditor.accountMarkets(bob);

    console2.log("before:", marketsBefore);
    console2.log("after:", marketsAfter);
  }
```

Revert on zero borrows
