# Transfer from/to Non-Transferrer_role is possible - breaking core system assumptions in esEXA

## Summary
Inside EscrowEXA contract, the `TRANSFERRER_ROLE` is defined for `// @notice Role that can receive or transfer esEXA.`.
This statement  means only addresses having this role can send or receive these tokens.
However , due to wrong condition implementation , transfer from/to  addresses is possible that does not have this role.
## Vulnerability Detail
The smart contract defines the transferrer_role as follows

```solidity
/// @notice Role that can receive or transfer esEXA.
  bytes32 public constant TRANSFERRER_ROLE = keccak256("TRANSFERRER_ROLE");
  
```

Inside `_beforeTokenTransfer`, overriding is done to only allow exchanged between addresses that holds the `TRANSFERRER_ROLE`

```solidity
/// @notice ERC20 transfer override to only allow transfers from/to TRANSFERRER_ROLE holders.
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
    if (!hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, from) && !hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, to)) revert Untransferable();
    super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
  }
```

They way it does ensure this is by checking if both involved addresses have the required role or not

```solidity
    if (!hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, from) && !hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, to)) revert Untransferable();

```

Unfortunately , the check is wrong .

The current check allows to : 

- send Tokens from `from` address to `to` address where `from` has required role but `to`  does not .
- send Tokens from `from` address to `to` address where `from` do not have required role but `to`  does .

### Proof of concept
say we have two scenarios , 

we have addresses 0xa , 0xb ( for simplicity)

#### Scenario A:

0xa has Transferrer_role , 0xb does not 

then the check `    if (!hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, from) && !hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, to)) revert Untransferable();`

will evulate to `if(   !(TRUE) &&!(FALSE) )` => `if(  false && true  )`  => if(false ) revert....
when if is falsified, the revert will not execute hence the token transfer transaction will succeed.


#### Scenairio B:
0xb has Transferrer_role , 0xa does not 

then the check `    if (!hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, from) && !hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, to)) revert Untransferable();`

will evulate to `if(   !(False) &&!(TRUE) )` => `if(  true && false )`  => if(false ) revert....
when if is falsified , the revert will not execute hence the token transfer transaction will succeed.


In both scenarios, the transaction will happen leading to following impact.

## Impact
Transfer to and from the addresses is possible even if they don't have the `TRANSFERRER_ROLE`

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/periphery/EscrowedEXA.sol#L58-L62

```solidity
/// @notice ERC20 transfer override to only allow transfers from/to TRANSFERRER_ROLE holders.
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
    if (!hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, from) && !hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, to)) revert Untransferable();
    super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify this condition to following 

```solidity

 if (! ( hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, from) && hasRole(TRANSFERRER_ROLE, to) ) ) revert Untransferable();

```

this will ensure that if both addresses has the required role then the transfer will happen otherwise it won't.
