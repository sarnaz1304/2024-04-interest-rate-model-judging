# When protocol is paused, users can't repay, but debt keeps accruing.

## Summary
Even though users are not allowed to repay their borrow when a market is paused, the interest on their borrows keeps on accruing. 
At the time of repayment, they are required to pay interest that was accrued even when the market got paused.

## Vulnerability Detail
When protocol pauses a market, users are not allowed to do most operations, including `repay` and `repayAtMaturity` of borrows.

But as time goes, debt keeps on accruing as seen in `updateFloatingDebt` which is called by `repay` and `refund`:

```solidity
function updateFloatingDebt() internal returns (uint256 treasuryFee) {
    ...
    uint256 newDebt = memFloatingDebt.mulWadDown(
      interestRateModel
        .floatingRate(utilization, globalUtilization(memFloatingAssets, memFloatingDebt, floatingBackupBorrowed))
        .mulDivDown(block.timestamp - lastFloatingDebtUpdate, 365 days)
    );

    memFloatingDebt += newDebt;
    ...
  }

```

And `repayAtMaturity` requires user to pay an interest, depending on how much time has passed since the expiry of that maturity:

```solidity
function noTransferRepayAtMaturity(...)internal returns (uint256 actualRepayAssets) {
    ...
     if (block.timestamp < maturity) {
        ...
     } else {
      actualRepayAssets = debtCovered + debtCovered.mulWadDown((block.timestamp - maturity) * penaltyRate);

      // all penalties go to the earnings accumulator
      earningsAccumulator += actualRepayAssets - debtCovered;
    }
}
```

The users are forced to pay an interest depending on how long the pause duration was, even though they wanted to repay during the pause. 

## Impact
Even though users have no way to `repay` or `repayAtMaturity` during a market pause, their debt keeps on growing. User get penalized for no fault of theirs

## Recommendation

Interest or penalty should not accrue while a market is paused.
