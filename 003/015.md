# Borrower repayment of assets is subject to pausable limitations

## Summary
Borrower repayment of assets is subject to pausable limitations, which can result in an inability to repay when prices drop

## Vulnerability Detail
[Market.sol::repay](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L176-L183)
[Market.sol::refund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L190-L197)
[Market.sol::repayAtMaturity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L445-L458)
The above repayment function includes a `whenNotPaused` check.
Assuming the following scenario:

- A borrower deposits ETH as collateral assets.
- The borrower borrows DAI from the marketDAI.
- The PAUSER_ROLE pauses the contract.
- The ETH price drops, causing the borrower's position to fall below the health line.

After the PAUSER_ROLE unpauses the contract, the borrower intends to repay DAI to the contract. However, a liquidator can front-run to liquidate the borrower's position, which is unfair to the loan holder.

Add following test to file `Market.t.sol`
```solidity
  function testPauseLeadToUnableRepay() external {
    MockPriceFeed ethPriceFeed = new MockPriceFeed(18, 1e18);
    auditor.setPriceFeed(marketWETH,ethPriceFeed);
    auditor.enterMarket(market);

    vm.prank(BOB);
    market.deposit(10 ether,BOB);

    //deposit WETH as collateral.
    marketWETH.deposit(2 ether, address(this));

    //borrow dai from marketWETH.
    market.borrow(1 ether,address(this),address(this));

    //owner pause contract.
    market.grantRole(market.PAUSER_ROLE(), address(this));
    market.pause();

    //dai price drop.
    ethPriceFeed.setPrice(1e17);

    (uint256 collateral,uint256 debt) = auditor.accountLiquidity(address(this),Market(address(0)),0);

    //debt > collateral
    assert(debt > collateral);

    //borrower unable to repay.
    vm.expectRevert();
    market.repay(1 ether,address(this));
  }
```
As we can see borrower unable to repay eth, when owner `unpause` the contract , borrower's position can be front-run to liquidated.
