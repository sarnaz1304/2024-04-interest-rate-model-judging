# Inability to repay loan at maturity when the protocol is paused can force users to pay penalty fee

## Summary
Owing to the implementation if the `Market.sol` contract, there is a `pause()` functionality which is restricted to authorised roles. However, the `pause()` function is extended to critical functions of the `market` that could jeopardise the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
- Alice [takes out a loan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L281-L287) of 100,000DAI from a DAI Fixed Rate Pool with `maturity` of 40 weeks
- Due to some event DAI market is [paused](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L1126-L1128) by admin toward the end of the protocol
- At the maturity of the pool, Alice decides to close her `position` by calling [`repayAtMaturity(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L445-L450) but the market is paused and the call reverts
- Since the pool has matured and as time elapses, Alice position [accrues a penalty fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L511), hence even if Alice had good intentions to pay without defaulting, she is forced to pay extra in penalty.


## Impact
- Users who have the capacity to repay their loans without defaulting would be forced to pay penalty fees that will accrue until a `paused()` MATURE pool is `unpaused()`.
- Users can be liquidated when the protocol is unpaused if their position has become unhealthy.

## Tool used
Manual review


## Recommendation
Remove the `whenNotPaused` modifier from the [`repayAtMaturity(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L445-L450) function.
