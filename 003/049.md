# Inability to withdraw from a `maturity` pool when Market are paused

## Summary
Owing to the implementation if the `Market.sol` contract, there is a `pause()` functionality which is restricted to authorised roles. However, the `pause()` function is extended to critical functions of the `market` that could jeopardise the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
- Alice [makes a deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L232-L237) of 100,000DAI into a DAI Fixed Rate Pool with `maturity` of 40 weeks
- Due to some event DAI market is [paused](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L1126-L1128) by admin.
- Alice decide to withdraw by calling [`withdrawAtMaturity(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L363-L369) function but the call reverts with Alice funds stuck in the market


## Impact
- Users cannot withdraw their deposits when the market is paused and this can lead to users funds getting stuck in the market until the market is unpaused

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
Provide an `emergencyWithdraw(...)` method allowing users to withdraw their funds while foregoing rewards when the protocol is paused. This change should be carefully reviewed and tested to ensure it does not introduce other security risks.
