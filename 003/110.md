# Users can get liquidated by not being able to correct their position after an unpause

## Summary
Exactly protocol can pause each of their markets in case of emergency. The issue is that once its unpaused, users can get front-run by liquidator before even being able to act on their position and make it healthy.

## Vulnerability Detail
During a pause, all functions to modify a position in a market are unavailable (reverting because of `whenNotPaused()` modifier)
During this time, prices will continue to fluctuate, meaning that some position, healthy before the pause can become undercollateralized.
Once the market is unpaused, liquidator will be able to front-run most users and liquidate their position. 

## Impact
Unfair liquidation for naive users who will most probably not monitor the onchain events to improve their position, and probably not use advanced methods to get their tx on time.
Even experienced and equipped users can suffer from this, as they have no insurance they will act before liquidation/MEV bots.
