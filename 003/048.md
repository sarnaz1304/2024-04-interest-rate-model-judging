# Unhealthy positions cannot be liquidated when markets are paused

## Summary
Owing to the implementation if the `Market.sol` contract, there is a `pause()` functionality which is restricted to authorised roles. However, the `pause()` function is extended to critical functions of the `market` that could jeopardise the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
- Alice [takes out a loan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L281-L287) of 100,000DAI from a DAI Fixed Rate Pool with `maturity` of 40 weeks
- Due to some event DAI market is [paused](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L1126-L1128) by admin.
- Alice position becomes unhealthy, but it cannot be liquidated the protocols liquidation bots because the Market is paused and as such the [`liquidate(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L545-L549) function call will revert

This would be worse off in non-stable asset markets (if the protocol decides to implement one in the future) when there is unfavourable price action.

## Impact
- Users whose positions have become unhealthy cannot be liquidated and this can lead to insolvency of the protocol

## Tool used
Manual review


## Recommendation
Remove the `whenNotPaused` modifier from the [`liquidate(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L545-L549) function.
