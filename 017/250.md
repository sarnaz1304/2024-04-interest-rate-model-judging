# No slippage checks for deposit/mint/withdraw/redeem

## Summary

The amount that a user receives from an ERC4626 vault is dependent upon the amount of assets and shares that currently exist. When a user submits a transaction, there is no guarantee that the exchange rate will remain the same by the time the transaction is included in a block.

Per EIP4626:

"If implementors intend to support EOA account access directly, they should consider adding an additional function call for deposit/mint/withdraw/redeem with the means to accommodate slippage loss or unexpected deposit/withdrawal limits, since they have no other means to revert the transaction if the exact output amount is not achieved."

## Vulnerability Detail

Market does not include slippage functionality on deposit/mint/withdraw/redeem functions.

## Impact

Users may receive less assets/shares that they expect due to changes between when they submit a transaction and when the transaction is confirmed.

  /// @param shares amount of shares to be redeemed for underlying asset.
  /// @param receiver address to which the assets will be transferred.
  /// @param owner address which owns the floating pool assets.
  /// @return assets amount of underlying asset that was withdrawn.
  function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) public override returns (uint256 assets) {
    auditor.checkShortfall(this, owner, previewRedeem(shares));
    RewardsController memRewardsController = rewardsController;
    if (address(memRewardsController) != address(0)) memRewardsController.handleDeposit(owner);
    assets = super.redeem(shares, receiver, owner);
    emitMarketUpdate();
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include a slippage parameter in withdraw/redeem functions. Add a new external function to deposit and mint with a `minAmountOut` parameter.
