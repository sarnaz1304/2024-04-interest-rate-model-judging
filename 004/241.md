# Using deprecated Chainlink function latestAnswer

## Summary
According to Chainlink's documentation, the latestAnswer function is deprecated. This function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0. Besides, the latestAnswer is reported with 18 decimals for crypto quotes but 8 decimals for FX quotes (See Chainlink FAQ for more details). A best practice is to get the decimals from the oracles instead of hard-coding them in the contract.


## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    return uint256(price) * baseFactor;
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use latestrounddata
```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int256 price, , uint256 timeStamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracle.latestRoundData();
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "...");
require(timeStamp != 0, "...");
```
