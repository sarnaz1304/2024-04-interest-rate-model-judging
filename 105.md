# Contract assumes all the stablecoins are always 1:1 with USD which is not the case incase of a depeg event

## Summary
Because the contract assume stablecoins are always 1:1 with USD and directly uses the token amount which can lead to attacker can profit from it incase one of the stablecoin depegs.
See past depeg events here: [USDT](https://cointelegraph.com/news/untethered-the-history-of-stablecoin-tether-and-how-it-has-lost-its-1-peg), [DAI , USDC](https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-s-usdc-instability-causes-domino-effect-on-dai-usdd-stablecoins).

## Vulnerability Detail
Contract can set `baseFeed` as price feed
[Auditor.sol#L382-L386](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L382-L386)
```solidity
function setPriceFeed(Market market, IPriceFeed priceFeed) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
  if (address(priceFeed) != BASE_FEED && priceFeed.decimals() != priceDecimals) revert InvalidPriceFeed();
  markets[market].priceFeed = priceFeed; <@
  emit PriceFeedSet(market, priceFeed);
}
```

when price feed is `baseFeed` contract return token amont as token price instead of using chainlink
[Auditor.sol#L326-L332](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L326-L332)
```solidity
function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
  if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

  int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
  if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
  return uint256(price) * baseFactor;//@audit-info scale to 18 decimals.
}
```

when stablecoin price is  depeg attacker can profit from it eg: attacker can deposit depeg stablecoin as collateral and withdraw other tokens

## Recommendation
get token price from chainlink instead of using `baseFeed`
