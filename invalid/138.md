# `Block Timestamp` Dependence in Interest Calculation Functions

## Summary
The contract's interest rate calculation functions, such as `fixedRate`, rely on the block timestamp (`block.timestamp`), which can be slightly manipulated by miners. This could potentially affect the accuracy of interest calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Ethereum block timestamp can be influenced by miners within certain limits (approximately +/- 15 seconds). Contracts that use timestamps for logic related to time-sensitive operations may therefore have vulnerabilities if this manipulation affects contract outcomes.
## Impact
If a miner manipulates the timestamp, it could lead to incorrect interest rate calculations or enable timing-based exploits. The impact is likely low-medium since there are natural limitations on how much miners can manipulate timestamps and because economic incentives generally discourage extreme manipulation.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/InterestRateModel.sol#L121-L122
## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Recommendation
- Using an average of previous blocks' timestamps to mitigate single-point manipulation.
- Implementing a Time Oracle that provides signed timestamps from multiple trusted sources.
- Adding checks and balances around critical operations where exact timing matters significantly.
```solidity
import "./ITimeOracle.sol";

contract InterestRateModel {
    ITimeOracle public immutable timeOracle;

    constructor(ITimeOracle _timeOracle) {
        // ... other initializations ...
        timeOracle = _timeOracle;
    }

   function fixedRate(uint256 maturity /* other params */) public view returns (uint256) {
       uint256 currentTime = timeOracle.getCurrentTime();
       v.maturityFactor = (maturity - currentTime).divWadDown(
           // ... rest of code ...
       );
       
      //... rest of fixedRate implementation...
   }
}
```
This would require deploying a separate Time Oracle contract with its own security considerations but would reduce dependency risks associated with miner-controlled variables like `block.timestamp`.
