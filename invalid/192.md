# Treasury will receive less money (in shares) than expected

## Summary

The current mechanism for depositing to treasury might cause treasury to receive less money (in shares) than expected

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever earning is accrued, part of it will be 'charged', which mints the equivalent token amount worth of share to treasury. 

The problem is that depositToTreasury() uses previewDeposit() to determine the amount of shares and minting shares without an actual deposit. This will cause a small decrease in each share's value, leading to incorrect money worth of shares receive.

Consider this scenario:

- The current asset in market is 100 ETH
- The current total share supply is 100 shares
Assuming the amount is going to be sent to treasury is 2 ETH, which is roughly equivalent to 2 shares. Each share is worth 1 ETH

Now we should compare the difference between no actual deposit and normal case (there is an actual deposit):

Case 1: 2 shares is minted without an actual 2 ETH deposit ( current mechanism)

- The new asset in market is 100 ETH (because of no actual deposit)
- The new total share supply is 102 shares.
- Each share value: 100/102 = 0.98 ETH 

Case 2: Normal case, 2 shares is minted with 2 ETH deposit (normal case)

- The new asset in market is 102 ETH (because of no actual deposit)
- The new total share supply is 102 shares.
- Each share value: 102/102 = 1 ETH

As we can see, in Case 1 we lose some small amount of money.

## Impact
The protocol will earn slightly less money than expected

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider calculating shares manually instead of using previewDeposit(). Previewing deposit is for hypothetical deposit; without an actual deposit things are not going as expected
