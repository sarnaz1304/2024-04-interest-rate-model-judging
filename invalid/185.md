# More earning is allocated than needed to clear bad debts

## Summary
More earning is allocated than needed to clear bad debts due to incorrect deductions.

## Vulnerability Detail

To calculate total bad debt, the code will go through a loop to calculate bad debts from each maturities of fixed rate market and then calculate bad debts from the floating pool.

The problem is that bad debts from fixed rate markets are both deducted from earnings accumulator and added into totalBadDebt. totalBadDebt, including previous fixed rate bad debts which are already taken away in the loop, is withdrawn from earnings accumulator again at the end of the function. As a result, bad debts from fixed rate markets are being subtracted twice from earnings accumulator.

- Bad debts from fixed rate market are both subtracted from accumulator and added into total debt. At the end, total debt, including these bad debts, is deducted again from accumulator.
```solidity
while (packedMaturities != 0) {
      if (packedMaturities & 1 != 0) {
        FixedLib.Position storage position = fixedBorrowPositions[maturity][borrower];
        uint256 badDebt = position.principal + position.fee;
        if (accumulator >= badDebt) {
          RewardsController memRewardsController = rewardsController;
          if (address(memRewardsController) != address(0)) memRewardsController.handleBorrow(borrower);
     >>>     accumulator -= badDebt; 
     >>>     totalBadDebt += badDebt;
          floatingBackupBorrowed -= fixedPools[maturity].repay(position.principal);
          delete fixedBorrowPositions[maturity][borrower];
          account.fixedBorrows = account.fixedBorrows.clearMaturity(maturity);

          emit RepayAtMaturity(maturity, msg.sender, borrower, badDebt, badDebt);
        }
      }
      packedMaturities >>= 1;
      maturity += FixedLib.INTERVAL;
    }
    if (account.floatingBorrowShares != 0 && (accumulator = previewRepay(accumulator)) != 0) {
      (uint256 badDebt, ) = noTransferRefund(accumulator, borrower);
      totalBadDebt += badDebt;
    }
    if (totalBadDebt != 0) {
    >>>  earningsAccumulator -= totalBadDebt; 
      emit SpreadBadDebt(borrower, totalBadDebt);
    }
```

## Impact

Users will lose their earnings unnecessarily to cover bad debts (more than expected)
