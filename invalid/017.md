# Decrease the number of max future pools can lead to user unable to withdraw assets

## Summary
Owner can use [Market.sol::setMaxFuturePools](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L1093-L1099) to decrease the number of max future pools , which can lead to those users who deposit assets to contract before number decrease unable to withdraw assets.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  /// @notice Sets the protocol's max future pools for fixed borrowing and lending.
  /// @dev If value is decreased, VALID maturities will become NOT_READY.
  /// @param futurePools number of pools to be active at the same time.
  function setMaxFuturePools(uint8 futurePools) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    maxFuturePools = futurePools;//@audit pool can be decreased need to be checked.
    emit MaxFuturePoolsSet(futurePools);
  }
```
According to comment owner can decrease the future pools which can make `VALID`  maturities become `NOT_READY`  If user deposit at maturity before pool decrease will unable to withdraw assets due to the [FixedLib.sol::checkPoolState](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/utils/FixedLib.sol#L207-L224)

add test to file `Market.t.sol`:
```solidity
  function testDepositAndWithdraw() external {
    marketWETH.depositAtMaturity(FixedLib.INTERVAL * 10, 1e18, 1, address(this));

    //owner decrease future pools.
    marketWETH.setMaxFuturePools(5);

    //user withdraw assets.
    vm.expectRevert(
      abi.encodeWithSelector(UnmatchedPoolStates.selector,4,3,2)
    );
    marketWETH.withdrawAtMaturity(FixedLib.INTERVAL * 10,1e18,0,address(this),address(this));
  }
```

## Impact
user is unable to withdraw assets
