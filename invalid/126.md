# Bad Debt can accumulate in Markets

## Summary
Upon a liquidation event in a market, bad debt is only cleared if an account has no collateral left accross all markets they are in. However dust amounts of collateral will stop bad debt from being cleared causing build up which will reduce pool liquidity. This will impact user's ability to withdraw funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
the liquidation function in Market.sol clears bad debt by calling handleBadDebt in the auditor.sol.

The handleBadDebt function in auditor then attempts to clear bad debt in all markets the user has a position in if they have no collateral across all markets. This is a defensive technique to ensure the user's overall position across all markets remains healthy after a liquidation event.

However this can be problematic because this means upon a liquidation event, bad debt will not be cleared if there is dust amount collateral in any market other than the seize market. consider the following scenario:

1. Alice borrows from market A, posts sufficient collateral in market B, but also has dust collateral in market C.
2. Alice's borrow position  is underwater and can be fully liquidated, so Bob initiates liquidation to fully seize collateral in market B.
3. The liquidation function seizes all collateral in market B, then calls the auditor to handle bad debt.
4. The auditor goes through all the markets Alice is in, and returns without removing bad debt because of dust amount of collateral in market C.
5. Bad debt remains in market A.
 
## Impact

This edge case will cause bad debt to build up in the market, which is problematic and can for instance make users unable to withdraw funds they added to the floating pool. calls to withdraw the liquidity will revert with InsufficientProtocolLiquidity error.

        function testLiquidateAndDisableDistributeLosses() external {
    // @audit POC addeed by me
    marketWETH.deposit(1.15 ether, address(this));
    marketLINK.deposit(100000 wei, address(this));
    market.deposit(50_000 ether, ALICE);

    }
    daiPriceFeed.setPrice(0.003333333333333e18);

    uint256 bobDAIBalanceBefore = ERC20(market.asset()).balanceOf(BOB);
    uint256 accumulatorBefore = market.earningsAccumulator();
    vm.prank(BOB);
    market.liquidate(address(this), type(uint256).max, marketWETH);
    uint256 bobDAIBalanceAfter = ERC20(market.asset()).balanceOf(BOB);
    uint256 accumulatorAfter = market.earningsAccumulator();
    uint256 totalethDebt = 1_000 ether * 4;
    // if 110% is 1.15 ether then 100% is 1.0454545455 ether * 3_000 (eth price) = 3136363636363636363637

    uint256 lendersIncentive = uint256(3136363636363636363637).mulWadDown(0.01e18);
    (, uint256 fixedBorrows, ) = market.accounts(address(this));

    // @audit BOB SEIZES ALL ACCOUNT COLLATERAL BUT Fixed borrows(bad debt) 
    // still remain in market even after full liquidation
    // because of dust collateral in third LINK market
    assertEq(weth.balanceOf(BOB), 1.15 ether);

      assertTrue(principal + fee > 0);
      totalFixedDebt += principal;
    }

    assertTrue(market.floatingBackupBorrowed() > 0);

      vm.warp(FixedLib.INTERVAL * 1);

        // is impacted by bad debt buildup caused by other user

        vm.expectRevert(InsufficientProtocolLiquidity.selector);
        market.withdraw(bal, ALICE, ALICE);
      }

The test above demonstrates the scenario explained earlier. please note that for this test, a new market called marketLINK, new link asset and priceFeed as well was created and used as mocks. as can be seen below:

         marketLINK = Market(address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(new Market(assetLINK, auditor)), "")));
        marketLINK.initialize(
          "LINK",
          3,
          1e18,
          InterestRateModel(address(irm)),
          0.02e18 / uint256(1 days),
          1e17,
          0,
          0.0046e18,
          0.42e18
        );
        vm.label(address(marketLINK), "MarketLINK");
        
        linkPriceFeed = new MockPriceFeed(18, 1e18);
        auditor.enableMarket(marketLINK, linkPriceFeed, 0.9e18);
        
        auditor.enterMarket(marketLINK);
        
        assetLINK.mint(BOB, 50_000 ether);
        //assetLINK.mint(ALICE, 50_000 ether);
        assetLINK.mint(address(this), 1_000_000 ether);
        
        assetLINK.approve(address(marketLINK), type(uint256).max);

## Recommendation

While the current setup that consider's the users overall position makes sense, there should be additional consideration given to when bad debt should be cleared from a specific market. 

For instance, similar to how the protocol factors in the Risk-Adjust Factor in order to assess the lending power of each collateral asset, one potential idea could be to rank the collateral by their relative size, for instance , if the user's position size in Market C has an overall weight considerably less than those in other markerts, it should not impact bad debt removal actions for those markets.
