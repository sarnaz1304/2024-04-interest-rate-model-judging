# Timing Validity in `RewardsController::config()` needs enhanced time validations

## Summary
The contracts lacks specific checks for `start` and `end` parameters, and there is a possibility of `start` being in the past.

## Vulnerability Detail
The code in function `config()` does include some checks designed to prevent misconfig regarding the timing of the reward distributions but it only checks if `block.timestamp` is before `end` and after `start`. However, there is no explicit protection for misconfiguration that sets `start` in the past but still before `end`, in which case the function will not revert. 

## Impact
This situation makes the distribution begin already "in progress", potentially disrupting expectations for the distribution's availability or accessibility. This could also allow setting short distribution periods that start in the recent past but haven't ended at the time of configuration, leading to scenarios where the distribution is only active for a very brief time, potentially locking users out. This misconfig could eventually lead to disruption of rewards calculations or fairness.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check explicitly ensure start > block.timestamp would prevent any distribution from being configured to start in the past, regardless of the other conditions.

```diff
+ require (start > block.timestamp, "Start cannot be in the past!");
```
