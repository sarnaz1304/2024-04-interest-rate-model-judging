# No check if Optimism L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary

Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure the sequencer's live status before trusting the data returned by the oracle. This check is missing in all instances where the price is fetched from the oracle.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the Optimism Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, potentially resulting in stale information. Nevertheless, users can still interact with the protocol directly through the L1 optimistic rollup contract. For further details, you can review the Chainlink docs on [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds).

As a result, users may still utilize the protocol even if the oracle feeds are stale.

## Impact

The bug could be exploited by malicious actors to capitalize on the sequencer downtime.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the sequence check.

```solidity
(
    /*uint80 roundID*/,
    int256 answer,
    uint256 startedAt,
    /*uint256 updatedAt*/,
    /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();

// Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
// Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
if (!isSequencerUp) {
    revert SequencerDown();
}

// Make sure the grace period has passed after the
// sequencer is back up.
uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
    revert GracePeriodNotOver();
}
```
