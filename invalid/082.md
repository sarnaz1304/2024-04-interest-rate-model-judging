# [M-17] `InstallmentsRouter::borrow` - Lack of Access Control Allows Unauthorized Borrowing

## Summary

The `InstallmentsRouter` contract lacks proper access control mechanisms in the `borrow` function, allowing any account to borrow on behalf of other accounts without their consent or authorization. This vulnerability stems from the absence of checks to verify if the borrower has granted permission to the caller to borrow on their behalf.

## Vulnerability Detail

Add the following test to `InstallmentsRouter.t.sol`
```javascript
 function testUnauthorizedBorrow() external {
    uint256 bobBalanceBefore = address(bob).balance;

    // Calculate the next valid maturity timestamp
    uint256 maturity = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % FixedLib.INTERVAL) + FixedLib.INTERVAL;

    // Attacker borrows on behalf of Bob without approval
    uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](3);
    amounts[0] = 1e18;
    amounts[1] = 1e18;
    amounts[2] = 1e18;
    uint256 maxRepay = 3.1e18;

    // Expect a revert
    vm.expectRevert();

    // Borrow on behalf of Bob
    router.borrowETH(maturity, amounts, maxRepay);
  }
```
Run this test with `forge test --mt testUnauthorizedBorrow`

Here is a walkthrough of the test:

The test calculates the next valid maturity timestamp based on the current block timestamp and the `FixedLib.INTERVAL` constant.

It prepares an array of borrowing amounts (amounts) and sets the maximum repayment amount (maxRepay).

The test uses `vm.expectRevert()` to expect a revert to occur in the subsequent function call.

It calls the `borrowETH` function of the `InstallmentsRouter` contract, attempting to borrow on behalf of the bob account without approval.

After running the test, you will see that the test does indeed pass, indicating that the `borrowETH` function allows unauthorized borrowing on behalf of other accounts.

## Impact

The lack of access control in the `InstallmentsRouter` contract can lead to unauthorized borrowing, where an attacker can manipulate the borrowing function to create debt on behalf of other accounts without their approval. This vulnerability has the following potential impacts:

Financial Risks: Unauthorized borrowing can result in unexpected debt for the affected accounts, potentially leading to financial losses if the borrowed funds are not repaid.

Disruption of Protocol Functionality: The vulnerability undermines the trust and integrity of the lending and borrowing mechanisms within the protocol. Users may lose confidence in the protocol's ability to protect their accounts and funds.

Reputational Damage: If the vulnerability is exploited or becomes public knowledge, it could harm the protocol's reputation, leading to a loss of user trust and potential impact on the protocol's adoption and growth.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerability exploits the lack of access control in the `borrow` function of the `InstallmentsRouter` contract.

## Recommendation
To mitigate the unauthorized borrowing vulnerability, the following measures should be implemented:

Access Control: Introduce access control mechanisms in the InstallmentsRouter contract to ensure that only authorized accounts can borrow on behalf of others. This can be achieved by implementing a permission system or requiring explicit approval from the borrower.

Borrower Authorization: Modify the borrowing functions to include a check that verifies if the borrower has authorized the caller to borrow on their behalf. This can be done through a separate authorization function or by utilizing a signature-based approval mechanism.

Emitting Events: Emit events whenever a borrowing transaction occurs, including information about the borrower, the caller, and the borrowed amount. This helps in tracking and auditing borrowing activities.
