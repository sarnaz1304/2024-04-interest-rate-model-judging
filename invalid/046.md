# Users' repay/liquidation may can't be discounted


## Summary

Users' `repay/liquidation` actions may can't be discounted because use `block.timestamp` to judge if maturity is passed or not.


## Vulnerability Detail

Both `Market#liquidate` and `Market#repay` actions call `Market#noTransferRepayAtMaturity`, inside the function, it judge the actual repay assets if can be discounted or not based on `block.timestamp` and `maturity` parameters.

```solidity
function noTransferRepayAtMaturity() {
    ...
    if (block.timestamp < maturity) {
      if (canDiscount) {
        // calculate the deposit fee considering the amount of debt the account'll pay
        (uint256 discountFee, uint256 backupFee) = pool.calculateDeposit(principalCovered, backupFeeRate);

        // remove the fee from unassigned earnings
        pool.unassignedEarnings -= discountFee + backupFee;

        // the fee charged to the fixed pool supplier goes to the earnings accumulator
        earningsAccumulator += backupFee;

        // the fee gets discounted from the account through `actualRepayAssets`
        actualRepayAssets = debtCovered - discountFee;
      } else {
        actualRepayAssets = debtCovered;
      }
    }
    ...
}
```

But it use `block.timestamp` means the validators can pending the txs in the mempool at any time, so if the tx pending some time and the maturity can be expired, such that the users can't be discounted. 


[`Market#previewDebt`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L792-L816) function also have such an issue.

## Impact

Users' repay/liquidation may can't be discounted.

## Tool used

vscode, Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use hardcoded timestamp when call `Market#noTransferRepayAtMaturity` function.
