# Arithmetic Operations (Potential Underflow/Overflow Without Explicit Checks)

## Summary
The smart contract must ensure that all arithmetic operations are safe from underflows and overflows. Solidity ^0.8.x provides built-in checks, but these need to be verified throughout the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
Solidity 0.8.x automatically includes checks for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow; however, it is crucial to verify that this version's features are correctly utilized across all mathematical computations within the contract.
## Impact
If not properly handled, unsafe arithmetic operations can lead to critical vulnerabilities allowing attackers to manipulate accounting logic resulting in loss or creation of tokens/assets illegitimately which could severely compromise the integrity of the financial logic within a smart contract system.

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Recommendation
Ensure no unchecked blocks are used around arithmetic calculations unless absolutely necessary and audited thoroughly:
```javascript
// Example without unchecked block - Safe due automatic revert on overflow/underflow 
uint256 newTotal = total + amount;

// Potentially unsafe example with unchecked block - Use cautiously!
unchecked {
   uint256 newTotal = total + amount;
}
```
