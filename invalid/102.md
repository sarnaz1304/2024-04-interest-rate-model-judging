# EscrowExa functionalities are not available for approved users of the exa tokens

## Summary
Most functions inside the escrow contract requires the msg.sender to be the owner of the token they are using.
However , this functionality should also be available for approved users of those token owners.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity

  function vest(
    uint128 amount,
    address to,
    uint256 maxRatio,
    uint256 maxPeriod,
    Permit calldata p
  ) external returns (uint256 streamId) {
    exa.safePermit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
    return vest(amount, to, maxRatio, maxPeriod);
  }


 function vest(uint128 amount, address to, uint256 maxRatio, uint256 maxPeriod) public returns (uint256 streamId) {
    assert(amount != 0);
    if (reserveRatio > maxRatio || vestingPeriod > maxPeriod) revert Disagreement();

    _burn(msg.sender, amount);
     // snip
}

function cancel(uint256[] memory streamIds) external returns (uint256 streamsReserves) {
    //snip
   assert(msg.sender == sablier.getRecipient(streamId));
   
    emit Cancel(msg.sender, streamIds);
    _mint(msg.sender, refundableAmount);
    exa.safeTransfer(msg.sender, streamsReserves);
//snip
  }

  function withdrawMax(uint256[] memory streamIds) public {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < streamIds.length; ++i) {
      uint256 streamId = streamIds[i];
      checkStream(streamId);
      assert(msg.sender == sablier.getRecipient(streamId));
      withdrawMax(streamId);
    }
  }
```
and others . 
These methods should allow counter-parts of them that allows approved addresses to take action on behalf of owner as 
it is much well-adopted method by majority of wealthy crypto users that token owners don't usually do all the heavy lifting of investing stuff by themselves  but they have approved individuals who makes the investment decisions  and the token owners 
receive the rewards.

## Impact
The Escrow functionality is broken for Approved addresses of tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add token-approved-addresses specific functions to reach entire crypto community .

## Severity 
The severity is high due to the impact of not being able to be operatable for a majority of token holders
and this kind of vulnerability has been marked as High in the [Past sherlock contest](https://solodit.xyz/issues/h-02-votingescrows-merge-and-withdraw-arent-available-for-approved-users-code4rena-velodrome-finance-velodrome-finance-git)
