# zero asset price in `Auditor.sol#assetPrice` when using underlying tokens having 18 decimals

## Summary
A critical flaw has been identified in `Auditor.sol`, particularly in the `assetPrice` function, which impacts the calculation of asset prices for underlying assets with 18 decimals. The flaw stems from the calculation of the `baseFactor`, which results in a zero value when multiplied by the price of assets with 18 decimals. Consequently, this flaw affects various functions in `Auditor.sol`, including `checkLiquidation`, `calculateSeize`, and `handleBadDebt`, potentially leading to inaccurate calculations and erroneous outcomes.

## Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability arises from the incorrect multiplication of the `baseFactor` with price on an assumption that the baseFactor will always be greater than 0 due to having underlying token always have less than 18 decimals, resulting in a zero value when multiplied by the price of assets with 18 decimals. 
However , in Exactly's Docs , there are multiple feeds listed , one of them is DAI/ETH, where the decimals in DAI is 18 which is a standard ERC20 token.

As a result, the `assetPrice` function returns zero as the price of the asset, affecting subsequent calculations in functions such as `accountLiquidity`, `checkLiquidation`, `calculateSeize`, and `handleBadDebt`.

## Impact
The impact of this issue  is significant.
Here are the potential issues In my mind : 

### Potential Risks:
1. **Inaccurate Liquidation Assessments:** The `checkLiquidation` function relies on accurate asset prices to determine the liquidation status of accounts. However, the flawed zero price of  `assetPrice` function will lead to incorrect liquidations.

2. **Erroneous Asset Seizure Calculations:**  In the `calculateSeize` function, inaccurate asset prices will lead to incorrect calculations of the amount of collateral to be seized from user accounts.

3. **Mismanagement of Bad Debt:** In the `handleBadDebt` function, inaccurate asset prices may result in improper identification of accounts with bad debt, leading to inadequate debt handling and potential financial losses for lenders.

```solidity

 function accountLiquidity(
    address account,
    Market marketToSimulate,
    uint256 withdrawAmount
  ) public view returns (uint256 sumCollateral, uint256 sumDebtPlusEffects) {
// snip

  vars.price = assetPrice(m.priceFeed);

//snip
}
  function checkLiquidation(
    Market repayMarket,
    Market seizeMarket,
    address borrower,
    uint256 maxLiquidatorAssets
  ) external view returns (uint256 maxRepayAssets) {
   // snip

        Market market = marketList[i];
        MarketData storage marketData = markets[market];
        MarketVars memory m = MarketVars({
          price: assetPrice(marketData.priceFeed),
          adjustFactor: marketData.adjustFactor,
          baseUnit: 10 ** marketData.decimals
        });

//snip
}
  function calculateSeize(
    Market repayMarket,
    Market seizeMarket,
    address borrower,
    uint256 actualRepayAssets
  ) external view returns (uint256 lendersAssets, uint256 seizeAssets) {

    // read prices for borrowed and collateral markets
    uint256 priceBorrowed = assetPrice(markets[repayMarket].priceFeed);
  //snip

}

  function handleBadDebt(address account) external {
//snip

//snip
}
```
## Code Snippet

The vulnerability originates from the flawed calculation of the `baseFactor` in the constructor of the `Auditor` contract, resulting in a zero value when multiplied by the price of assets with 18 decimals.

Affected Code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L45

```solidity
// Constructor of Auditor.sol
constructor(uint256 priceDecimals_) {
    priceDecimals = priceDecimals_;
    baseFactor = 10 ** (18 - priceDecimals_);
    basePrice = 10 ** priceDecimals_;

    _disableInitializers();
}

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L331

// Function to retrieve asset price
function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    return uint256(price) * baseFactor; // Potential flaw in calculation
}
```

## Tool used
Manual code review.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to multiply by baseFactor only if the underlying token does not have 18 decimals.
