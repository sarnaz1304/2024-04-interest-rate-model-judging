# Invalid Estimation of an Important Protocol Invariant

## Summary
- When a user wants to withdraw a certain amount, the protocol tries to estimate whether the account will be unheathy or not. If not, then allows the user to withdraw. This estimation and what actual happens after the withdraw has a descrpency whenever the share value is >1. 

## Vulnerability Detail
- In the withdraw method, the protocol checks beforehand whether withdrawing the assets mentioned would result in the account being unhealthy or not. When the actual withdrawal happens, assets are converted into shares and subtracted from the account. This conversion is rounded up to be in the protocol's favor. Since the invariant was checked earlier with the assets users provided and the effective assets withdrawn due to shares conversion being rounded up are different, for some maximum amount, withdrawal is allowed even though the account becomes unhealthy right after.
    
## Impact
- The core invariant is compromised, as user actions can render the position unhealthy.

## Code Snippet
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L726

## POC
- Add below test in `test/Market.t.sol`
```solidity

  function testInvalidEstimationOfInvariant() external {
    //enter the market
    market.auditor().enterMarket(market);
    //deposit
    market.deposit(0.01 ether, address(this));
    //borrow
    uint256 borrowShares = market.borrow(0.005 ether, address(this), address(this));

    //wait for 1 block which is enough so that atleast 1 wei is accured as interest
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 seconds);

    (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = auditor.accountLiquidity(address(this), Market(address(0)), 0);
    require(collateral >= debt, "account should be healthy at this point");

    // This is the amount for which withdrawal is allowed even though account becomes unhealthy immediately after the withdrawal
    market.withdraw(2_187_499_910_816_211, address(this), address(this));

    (collateral, debt) = auditor.accountLiquidity(address(this), Market(address(0)), 0);
    //notice that the account is unhealthy after the withdrawal which shouldn't be allowed
    require(collateral < debt, "account should be unhealthy");
  }

```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Check the invariant (whether the account is healthy or not) at the end of the withdrawal instead of estimating it at the start.
