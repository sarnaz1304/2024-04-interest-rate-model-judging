# Input Validation Issue in `internalSeize` Function (Invalid Market Instance Parameter)

## Summary
The function `internalSeize` lacks a critical input validation to ensure that the provided parameter is an instance of a legitimate and active Market contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the smart contract method `internalSeize`, thereâ€™s no check to authenticate if the passed `seizeMarket` address truly corresponds to a valid Market contract. This leaves room for manipulation where an invalid or malicious market address could be used, which might not conform with expected behaviors leading to improper asset seizure.
## Impact
Improper validation checks can result in unauthorized or unintended behavior including fund losses, due seize logic being executed against non-conforming contracts that could have divergent side effects from what is intended by protocol design norms and security assumptions inherent within its operational framework.

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Recommendation
Implement interface adherence verification ensuring only validly-deployed instances interacting:
```solidity
require(
   IERC165(address(seizemarket)).supportsInterface(interfaceId), 
   "Param does not implement required interface"
);
```
