# Not possible to borrow from the router because no allowance was given

## Summary

MarketETHRouter won't function properly with `borrow()` because no allowance was given in the `Market.::borrow()`

## Vulnerability Detail

Market::borrow() tries to spend allowance but didn't approved Router contract anywhere.

```solidity
/// @notice Borrows a certain amount from the floating pool.
  /// @param assets amount to be sent to receiver and repaid by borrower.
  /// @param receiver address that will receive the borrowed assets.
  /// @param borrower address that will repay the borrowed assets.
  /// @return borrowShares shares corresponding to the borrowed assets.
  function borrow(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address borrower
  ) external whenNotPaused whenNotFrozen returns (uint256 borrowShares) {
    spendAllowance(borrower, assets);

    RewardsController memRewardsController = rewardsController;
    if (address(memRewardsController) != address(0)) memRewardsController.handleBorrow(borrower);

    depositToTreasury(updateFloatingDebt());

    borrowShares = previewBorrow(assets);

    uint256 newFloatingDebt = floatingDebt + assets;
    floatingDebt = newFloatingDebt;
    // check if the underlying liquidity that the account wants to withdraw is borrowed, also considering the reserves
    if (floatingBackupBorrowed + newFloatingDebt > floatingAssets.mulWadDown(1e18 - reserveFactor)) {
      revert InsufficientProtocolLiquidity();
    }

    totalFloatingBorrowShares += borrowShares;
    accounts[borrower].floatingBorrowShares += borrowShares;

    emit Borrow(msg.sender, receiver, borrower, assets, borrowShares);
    emitMarketUpdate();

    auditor.checkBorrow(this, borrower);
    asset.safeTransfer(receiver, assets);
  }
 ```
