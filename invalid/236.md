# Lack of slippage control in the functions of the `Market` contract

## Summary

[EIP4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#security-considerations) mentions that "if implementors intend to support EOA account access directly, they should consider adding an additional function call for `deposit`/`mint`/`withdraw`/`redeem` with the means to accommodate slippage loss or unexpected deposit/withdrawal limits, since they have no other means to revert the transaction if the exact output amount is not achieved." Using the `Market` contract that inherits the ERC4626 contract, EOAs can call the following `deposit()` , `mint()` , `withdraw()` and `redeem()` functions directly (or with other functions in the `Market` that include maturity). However, because no slippage controls can be specified when calling these functions, these functions' `shares` and `assets` outputs can be less than expected to these EOAs. The `MarketETHRouter` contract also does not perform slippage checks.

## Vulnerability Detail

All 4 functions mentioned can be called directly from the `Market` contract and do not include slippage check.

```solidity
    /** @dev See {IERC4626-deposit}. */
    function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public virtual returns (uint256) {
        uint256 maxAssets = maxDeposit(receiver);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(receiver, assets, maxAssets);
        }

        uint256 shares = previewDeposit(assets);
        _deposit(_msgSender(), receiver, assets, shares);

        return shares;
    }

    /** @dev See {IERC4626-mint}. */
    function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) public virtual returns (uint256) {
        uint256 maxShares = maxMint(receiver);
        if (shares > maxShares) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxMint(receiver, shares, maxShares);
        }

        uint256 assets = previewMint(shares);
        _deposit(_msgSender(), receiver, assets, shares);

        return assets;
    }
```
```solidity
  function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) public override returns (uint256 assets) {
    auditor.checkShortfall(this, owner, previewRedeem(shares));
    RewardsController memRewardsController = rewardsController;
    if (address(memRewardsController) != address(0)) memRewardsController.handleDeposit(owner);
    assets = super.redeem(shares, receiver, owner);
    emitMarketUpdate();
  }
  
  function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public override returns (uint256 shares) {
    auditor.checkShortfall(this, owner, assets);
    RewardsController memRewardsController = rewardsController;
    if (address(memRewardsController) != address(0)) memRewardsController.handleDeposit(owner);
    shares = super.withdraw(assets, receiver, owner);
    emitMarketUpdate();
  }
```

There is no slippage check in any of the functions that with AtMaturity, are inherited from ERC4626, or are overridden. It simply does not allow the user to do this and does not comply with EIP.

## Impact

EOAs can mint less shares than expected when calling the `Market` contract's `ERC4626.deposit` function and likewise they can get unexpected results from other functions too.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `Market` contract can be updated to include a deposit function that allows `msg.sender` to specify the minimum shares to be minted for calling the corresponding `ERC4626.deposit` function; calling such `Market.deposit` function should revert if the corresponding `ERC4626.deposit` function's shares output is less than the specified minimum shares to be minted. These updates can be made in the same way for other functions in question.
