# `Market.previewDebt` function rounds down during the debt calculation

## Summary

`Market.previewDebt` function rounds down during the debt calculation

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Auditor.exitMarket` function is called to remove a market from the sender's account liquidity calculation. The function takes an `account snapshot` of the `msg.sender` to ensure sender does not have a `borrow balance` by calling the `Market.accountSnapshot` function as shown below:

```solidity
    (uint256 assets, uint256 debt) = market.accountSnapshot(msg.sender);

    // fail if the sender has a borrow balance
    if (debt != 0) revert RemainingDebt();
```

The `Market.accountSnapshot` function calls the `Market.previewDebt` function to get all all borrows and penalties for the respective account.

But the issue here is that while calculating the `penalty fee` for the delayed fixed pools borrowers after maturity, the calculation of the `penalty fee` rounds down `in favor of the account` where as it should `round up` in favor of the protocol.

## Impact

Since the `previewDebt` function loops through a  `while loop`, multiple iterations could overlook the `accumulating dust amounts` which add up to considerable `debt` amount had it been accounted for during the execution of the `previewDebt` function. For example if a token like `GUSD` which uses `2 decimals` is used by the protocol, a single rounding down would add an error of `0.01 USD` to the `debt calculation`. Hence multiple iterations could add onto this USD amount which is not considered thus `debt != 0` check is not correctly followed.

Hence as a result the `if (debt != 0) revert RemainingDebt()` check will not revert even though there is `debt > 0 (due to accumulating penalty fee dust)` due to rounding down as explained above. This breaks the `if (debt != 0) revert RemainingDebt()` check as a result thus allowing `exitMarket` operation with `debt owed by the account`.

## Tool used

Manual Review and VSCode

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to `roundUp` the `penalty fee` calculation in the `Market.previewDebt` function in favor of the protocol.
