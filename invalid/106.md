# Auditor assumes all price feeds have the same decimal

## Summary
different price feeds have different decimal precision while auditor contract assumes all price feeds have the same decimal precision.
## Vulnerability Detail
`assetPrice` function retrieves the price of different assets from different price feeds and multiplies it to baseFactor to convert the price to 18 decimal precision, the problem is that it multiplies price of all feeds to a single baseFactor ( assuming all price feeds have the same precision ) , generally, non-ETH pairs report using 8 decimals, since all prices are retrieved from USD pair so the auditor contract expects all price feeds to have the same precision of 8 while there are exceptions, for example, AMPL/USD price feed that reports using 18 decimals which breaks the general rule that USD price feeds report in 8 decimals, this leads to breaking calculation of account liquidity, debt, and liquidations,

also, we can see the same issue in the following bug report previously submitted at a Sherlock audit contest:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-08-sentiment-judging/blob/main/019-H/019-h.md


```solidity 

  function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    return uint256(price) * baseFactor;
  }
```
## Impact
breaks calculation of collateral and debt due to wrong decimal calculations

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider having different baseFactors for different price feeds instead of using a single baseFactor for all price feeds.
