# Reasses pausing repay functionalities

## Summary

Resses pausing repay functionalities

## Vulnerability Detail

`Market.sol` `repay`, `refund` and `repayAtMaturity` are behind `whenNotPaused`, they can't be reached in emergency event. Positions can be liquidatable after its unpausing. `clearBadDebt` is only per single address, where it won't check all of possible affected addresses.

## Impact

Users would wait only for the protocol owner to interpet in how to deal with bad debt during paused status for the contract.
