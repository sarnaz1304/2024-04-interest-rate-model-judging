# Market::liquidate() states calculateSeize reverts on failure, however this is incorrect

## Summary

`Market::liquidate()` contains a comment stating that some code revert on failure, however the comment is incorrect. This can lead to confusion across users and other devs integrating with the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Market.sol#L597-L599](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L597-L599)
```solidity
    // reverts on failure
    (uint256 lendersAssets, uint256 seizeAssets) = auditor.calculateSeize(this, seizeMarket, borrower, repaidAssets);
    earningsAccumulator += lendersAssets;
```

However [Auditor::calculateSeize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L273-L293) does not revert on failure, as there doesn't seem to be a failure condition within the function:
```solidity
  function calculateSeize(
    Market repayMarket,
    Market seizeMarket,
    address borrower,
    uint256 actualRepayAssets
  ) external view returns (uint256 lendersAssets, uint256 seizeAssets) {
    LiquidationIncentive memory memIncentive = liquidationIncentive;
    lendersAssets = actualRepayAssets.mulWadDown(memIncentive.lenders);

    // read prices for borrowed and collateral markets
    uint256 priceBorrowed = assetPrice(markets[repayMarket].priceFeed);
    uint256 priceCollateral = assetPrice(markets[seizeMarket].priceFeed);
    uint256 baseAmount = actualRepayAssets.mulDivUp(priceBorrowed, 10 ** markets[repayMarket].decimals);

    seizeAssets = Math.min(
      baseAmount.mulDivUp(10 ** markets[seizeMarket].decimals, priceCollateral).mulWadUp(
        1e18 + memIncentive.liquidator + memIncentive.lenders
      ),
      seizeMarket.maxWithdraw(borrower)
    );
  }
```
It seems the comment was meant to be placed a few lines lower, before this piece of code:
[Market.sol#L601-L607](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L601-L607)
```solidity
    if (address(seizeMarket) == address(this)) {
      internalSeize(this, msg.sender, borrower, seizeAssets);
    } else {
      seizeMarket.seize(msg.sender, borrower, seizeAssets);

      emitMarketUpdate();
    }
```
As `seize()` and `internalSeize()` do revert on failure.

## Impact

The incorrect comments can make users and dev assume that 
```solidity
(uint256 lendersAssets, uint256 seizeAssets) = auditor.calculateSeize(this, seizeMarket, borrower, repaidAssets);
```
will revert if `lendersAssets < seizeAssets` or possibly another interpretation of the code. This can cause confusion and incorrect integrations from other protocols.

## Recommendation

Move the comment to be directly on the block of code where `internalSeize()` and `seize()` are called to avoid confusion:

[Market.sol#L597C11-L607](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L597C11-L607)
```diff
-    // reverts on failure
    (uint256 lendersAssets, uint256 seizeAssets) = auditor.calculateSeize(this, seizeMarket, borrower, repaidAssets);
    earningsAccumulator += lendersAssets;

+    // reverts on failure
    if (address(seizeMarket) == address(this)) {
      internalSeize(this, msg.sender, borrower, seizeAssets);
    } else {
      seizeMarket.seize(msg.sender, borrower, seizeAssets);

      emitMarketUpdate();
    }
```
