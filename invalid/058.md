# Users are liquidated when their health factor is healthy rather than low.

## Summary
Users are liquidated when their health factor is healthy rather than low.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the current system, users are subjected to liquidation even when their health factor indicates a relatively stable financial position, rather than triggering liquidation when their health factor drops to a precarious level.

## Impact
Liquidating users with high health factors can result in unnecessary potential loss of assets for users who are actually in a stable position. 

## Code Snippet

### POC
```solidity

   function testLiquidateWhenHealthFactorisLow() external {
    market.deposit(10 ether, address(this));
    marketWETH.deposit(10 ether, BOB);
    daiPriceFeed.setPrice(1e18);
    vm.startPrank(BOB);
    auditor.enterMarket(marketWETH);
    market.borrow(4 ether, BOB, BOB);
    vm.stopPrank();

    market.setFrozen(true);
    daiPriceFeed.setPrice(1e19);
    market.liquidate(BOB, 4 ether, marketWETH);
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The liquidation criteria should be adjusted to align with the health factor, ensuring that users are liquidated only when their health factor indicates a significant risk rather than when it is high.
