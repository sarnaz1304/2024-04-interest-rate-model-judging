# Fixed Pool depositors may not receive any interest

## Summary
fixed pool depositors may not receive any interest despite that their assets have been borrowed and earn interest for protocol. 
## Vulnerability Detail
when users deposit at fixed pools, the fee amount that depositor would receive as interest is calculated by `calculateDeposit` function 
```solidity
function calculateDeposit(
    Pool memory pool,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 backupFeeRate
  ) internal pure returns (uint256 yield, uint256 backupFee) {
    uint256 memBackupSupplied = backupSupplied(pool);
    if (memBackupSupplied != 0) {
      yield = pool.unassignedEarnings.mulDivDown(Math.min(amount, memBackupSupplied), memBackupSupplied);
      backupFee = yield.mulWadDown(backupFeeRate);
      yield -= backupFee;
    }
  }
```
as we see if backupSupplied is 0 ( it means currently this amount is not being used to borrow ) yield ( fee amount ) would be 0 and depositors won't receive any interest despite that this amount probably would be borrowed in the future and interest of borrowed amount is directly transferred to treasury and depositor won't receive any interest,
