# floatingAssetsAverage is updated only on deposit and withdraw

## Summary

In current IRM, 

## Vulnerability Detail

When `Market` calculating the utilization rate for fixed borrows, an average of the variable pool deposits `(floatingAssetsAverage)` is passed to the IRM. The reason behind this is to prevent manipulation of a fixed borrow rate: a user could deposit a significant amount in the variable pool to lower the utilization, ask for a considerably cheap fixed borrow and then withdraw the initially deposited amount.

But, in current `Market.sol`, `updateFloatingAssetsAverage()` is only called in `beforeWithdraw` and `afterDeposit`, which means that none of these operations will trigger an update:

- Supplying Assets to the Fixed Rate Pools
- Borrowing Assets from the Variable Rate Pool
- Borrowing Assets from the Fixed Rate Pools
- Liquidations

However, all these functions will change the floatingAssets. This means that for a market where `deposit/withdraw` is inactive but other operations are active, the EMA will be extremely backward.

In `borrowAtMaturity`/`withdrawAtMaturity` operation, function `previewFloatingAssetsAverage()`  is used to get the EMA value of `floatingAssets`:

    function previewFloatingAssetsAverage() public view returns (uint256) {
      uint256 memFloatingAssets = floatingAssets;
      uint256 memFloatingAssetsAverage = floatingAssetsAverage;
      uint256 dampSpeedFactor = memFloatingAssets < memFloatingAssetsAverage ? dampSpeedDown : dampSpeedUp;
      uint256 averageFactor = uint256(1e18 - (-int256(dampSpeedFactor * (block.timestamp - lastAverageUpdate))).expWad());
      return memFloatingAssetsAverage.mulWadDown(1e18 - averageFactor) + averageFactor.mulWadDown(memFloatingAssets);
    }

Per [Exactly doc](https://docs.exact.ly/resources/math-paper#id-4.1.3-time-averaged-variable-rate-pool-supply):

When the elapsed time(since last update) is long, the smooth factor of EMA will tend to 1, and the return value will converge to  current `floatingAssets`, which can be inflated by donating to treasury.

## Impact

1. In a market where no one has `deposit`/`withdraw` in a long time, the EMA would be very inefficient and significantly behind current values, making users have to use more imprecise FloatingAssets values when borrow/repay from a fixed rate pool.
2. Attacker can inflate `floatingAssetsAverage` easily, because many functions that increase `floatingAssets` do not update `floatingAssetsAverage`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ideally, all funchtion which change `floatingAssets` value should update `floatingAssetsAverage`, because the assets ratio of floating and fixed pools may be unbalanced, adding exceptions for either side is undesirable.
