# Lack of Administrative Ability to Clear Bad Debt and Liquidate Positions

## Summary

The current contract lacks the administrative capability to clear bad debts and liquidate positions, posing a significant risk when the contract is paused. Pausing the contract halts operations, but positions that should be liquidated remain unresolved, potentially leading to financial issues. Allowing the administrator to liquidate positions and clear bad debts while restricting other user functions could mitigate this risk and maintain the contract's integrity during periods of pause.

## Vulnerability Detail


The vulnerability arises from the inability of the contract administrator to intervene and address bad debts or liquidate positions when the contract is paused. While pausing the contract may be necessary to mitigate risks, the lack of administrative control to clear bad debts and liquidate positions leaves the contract vulnerable to financial instability, especially during prolonged pauses.

## Impact


This vulnerability poses a significant risk of financial issues within the contract, particularly when the administrator pauses the contract due to identified risks. Without the ability to clear bad debts and liquidate positions, the contract may reach a critical point where users' earnings and collateral cannot cover outstanding debts, leading to potential losses and reputational damage.
