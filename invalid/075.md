# assetPrice() BASE_FEED not scaled to 18-digit decimals

## Summary
in `assetPrice()`, if `BASE_FEED` returns `basePrice` directly.
But `basePrice` may not be `18-digit decimals`, such as `usdc`.
Returning the wrong decimals will result in the wrong asset valuation

## Vulnerability Detail
`Auditor.assetPrice()` is used to get the price of the asset, which needs to be scaled to`18-digit decimals`
The code implementation is as follows:
```solidity
  function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
@>  if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    return uint256(price) * baseFactor;
  }
```

We can see in the code above. If it wasn't `BASE_FEED`, it would have `scaled to 18-digit decimals` of the price
> `uint256(price) * baseFactor`

If it is `BASE_FEED`, it returns `basePrice` directly.
>if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

But `basePrice` is in `priceDecimals_` not necessarily in `18-digit decimals` , e.g. `USDC`.
```solidity
contract Auditor is Initializable, AccessControlUpgradeable {
...
  constructor(uint256 priceDecimals_) {
    priceDecimals = priceDecimals_;
    baseFactor = 10 ** (18 - priceDecimals_);
@>  basePrice = 10 ** priceDecimals_;

    _disableInitializers();
  }

```

## Impact

Incorrect decimals of the price will result in an undervaluation of the collateral or debt.
If the asset is a debt it will be illegally borrowed against a large amount of assets, and if the asset is collateral it will result in early liquidation.

```diff
  function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
-   if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;
+   if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice * baseFactor;

    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    return uint256(price) * baseFactor;
  }
