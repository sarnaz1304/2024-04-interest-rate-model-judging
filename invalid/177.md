# In a rare scenario, a loan can be repaid/refunded with less assets than needed in `MarketETHRouter`

## Summary
If `MarketETHRouter` has excessive WETH balances, it's possible to repay or refund a loan with less assets than required.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [`repay`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/MarketETHRouter.sol#L80) and [`refund`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/MarketETHRouter.sol#L90) function in `MarketETHRouter` contract, `msg.value` is firstly wrapped into WETH, then transferred to market to repay or refund the loan. But the refund/repay amount is different to what has been paid in the function:

```solidity
  function repay(uint256 assets) external payable wrap returns (uint256 repaidAssets, uint256 borrowShares) {
    (repaidAssets, borrowShares) = market.repay(assets, msg.sender);

    if (msg.value > repaidAssets) unwrapAndTransfer(msg.value - repaidAssets);
  }
```

As we can see, `assets` is passed as parameter, but not `msg.value`. Which makes an user can pass distinct values in `assets` and `msg.value`. This is a rare case because the `receive` function only allows WETH address to send Ethers, however, it's possible because WETH can be transferred to this contract with no restrictions. In the case where there are excessive amount of WETH in the contract, an user can abuse this loophole to pay part of his loan.

## Impact
The likelihood of this is quite low, but the impact would be high, hence the medium severity.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function repay(uint256 assets) external payable wrap returns (uint256 repaidAssets, uint256 borrowShares) {
    (repaidAssets, borrowShares) = market.repay(assets, msg.sender);

    if (msg.value > repaidAssets) unwrapAndTransfer(msg.value - repaidAssets);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if `msg.value` is greater than `assets` before repay/refund action, and pass in the value in `msg.value` to market.
