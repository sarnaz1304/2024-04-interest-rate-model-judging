# solmate SafeTransferLib.sol function does not check contract size

## Summary
Solmate's safeTransferLib library does not check for contract size for a token address which may lead to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
the safetransfer and safetransferfrom don't check the existence of code at the token address. This is a known issue while using solmate's libraries. Hence this may lead to miscalculation of funds and may lead to loss of funds, because if safetransfer() and safetransferfrom() are called on a token address that doesn't have a contract in it, it will always return success, bypassing the return value check. 

## Impact
the function safetransfer and safetransferfrom returns sucess even the address doesnt have a contract in it as it doesnt check the contract size,Due to which protocol will think that funds have been transferred successfully, and records will be accordingly calculated, but in reality, funds were never transferred. So this will lead to miscalculation and possibly loss of funds
