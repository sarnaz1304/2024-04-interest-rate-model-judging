# [H1] Potential Reentrancy attack in market.sol smart contract

## Summary
The vulnerability identified in the _**Market.sol**_ contract of the Exactly Protocol is related to the potential for reentrancy attacks. This vulnerability arises from the structure of the liquidate function, where state changes are made after an external call to _**auditor.checkLiquidation**_. Although the state changes are made before the external call in the provided code snippet, the linter warning suggests a potential risk due to the external call's ability to call back into the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The liquidate function is designed to liquidate undercollateralized fixed/floating positions. It takes three parameters: borrower, maxAssets, and seizeMarket. The function begins by checking if the caller is the borrower, which is a good practice to prevent self-liquidation. It then proceeds to make an external call to auditor.checkLiquidation, passing the contract instance, the seize market, the borrower, and the maximum assets as parameters. The return value of this external call is assigned to maxAssets.

The potential vulnerability lies in the fact that the external call to auditor.checkLiquidation could potentially call back into the liquidate function before the function has completed its execution. This callback could exploit the state changes made after the external call, leading to a reentrancy attack.


## Impact
A successful reentrancy attack could allow an attacker to drain funds from the contract or manipulate its state in unintended ways. This could lead to significant financial losses for the protocol and its users. The impact of such an attack would depend on the specific implementation details of the auditor.checkLiquidation function and how it interacts with the liquidate function.

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risk of reentrancy attacks, it is recommended to follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This pattern suggests that you should make any external calls at the end of the function, after all effects (state changes) have been made. However, in cases where the external call's return value is needed for subsequent logic, you should ensure that any state changes are made in a way that is not dependent on the outcome of the external call.

Here's a revised version of the liquidate function that adheres to the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:

```solidity
function liquidate(
    address borrower,
    uint256 maxAssets,
    Market seizeMarket
) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 repaidAssets) {
    // Check conditions
    if (msg.sender == borrower) revert SelfLiquidation();

    // Interact with external contract to get the checked max assets
    uint256 checkedMaxAssets = auditor.checkLiquidation(this, seizeMarket, borrower, maxAssets);

    // Effects (state changes)
    // Since we're using the result of the external call, we need to ensure that our state changes
    // are not directly dependent on its outcome. This might involve additional checks or logic.
    // For demonstration, let's assume we're updating some state based on the borrower's account.
    // We'll use a placeholder for the actual state update logic.

    // Example placeholder for state update logic
    // This is where you would update your contract's state based on the borrower's account.
    // Ensure that this logic does not directly depend on the outcome of the external call.
    // accounts[borrower].someState = someValue;

    // Further logic based on the result of the external call...
    // This might involve additional checks or logic to handle different outcomes of the external call.

    // Return the repaid assets
    // This is a placeholder. Replace it with the actual logic to calculate and return the repaid assets.
    return repaidAssets;
}
```
