# [H1] Reentrancy Attack in exitMarket Function

## Summary
The vulnerability identified in the exitMarket function of the Auditor.sol contract is related to a reentrancy attack. This occurs when the contract's state is modified after an external call to another contract, potentially allowing a malicious contract to call back into the calling contract before the first call is finished.

## Vulnerability Detail
The specific issue arises from the sequence of operations within the exitMarket function. After obtaining the account's snapshot from the market, the function checks for a remaining debt and then calls checkShortfall to verify if the account is permitted to redeem all of their assets. This checkShortfall call is an external call to another contract, which is made after the state has been partially updated. If the called contract is malicious, it could exploit this by calling back into the exitMarket function before the state update is complete, leading to unexpected behavior or potential loss of funds.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it could allow an attacker to drain funds from the contract or manipulate its state in unintended ways. In the context of a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, this could lead to financial losses for users and potentially the insolvency of the protocol. The severity of the impact depends on the specific implementation details of the checkShortfall function and the contracts it interacts with.

## Tool used

Manual Review + Olympix

## Recommendation
In your exitMarket function, the external call is made to market.accountSnapshot(msg.sender). After this call, you modify the state by calling checkShortfall(market, msg.sender, assets). To mitigate the risk of a reentrancy attack, you should rearrange your code to make all state changes before making external calls.

Here's how you can refactor the exitMarket function :

```solidity
function exitMarket(Market market) external {
    MarketData storage m = markets[market];
    if (!m.isListed) revert MarketNotListed();

    // First, perform all checks and calculations that do not modify the state.
    (uint256 assets, uint256 debt) = market.accountSnapshot(msg.sender);

    // Check if the sender has a borrow balance.
    if (debt != 0) revert RemainingDebt();

    // Check if the sender is not permitted to redeem all of their assets.
    // This is a potential external call. Move it to the end to avoid reentrancy.
    // checkShortfall(market, msg.sender, assets);

    // Perform state modifications before the external call.
    uint256 marketMap = accountMarkets[msg.sender];
    uint256 marketMask = 1 << m.index;

    if ((marketMap & marketMask) == 0) return;
    accountMarkets[msg.sender] = marketMap & ~marketMask;

    // Now, it's safe to make the external call.
    checkShortfall(market, msg.sender, assets);

    emit MarketExited(market, msg.sender);
}
```
