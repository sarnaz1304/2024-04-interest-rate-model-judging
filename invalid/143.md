# Unchecked Underflow in `spendAllowance` (Risk of Allowance Underflow)

## Summary
The `spendAllowance` function does not check the result of an allowance subtraction operation, potentially leading to underflows.
## Vulnerability Detail
In Solidity ^0.8.x, arithmetic operations revert on overflow and underflow by default. However, it's best practice to ensure that allowances cannot be manipulated through unchecked subtractions explicitly.
## Impact
An unchecked allowance could lead to a situation where an account is able to spend more than the approved amount if proper checks are not implemented or relied upon implicitly without explicit validation within smart contract logic flows.

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Recommendation
Add explicit require statements ensuring no underflow can occur:
```diff
function spendAllowance(address account, uint256 assets) internal {
    if (msg.sender != account) {
      uint256 allowed = allowance[account][msg.sender]; // saves gas for limited approvals.
+    // Ensure there are enough allowances to cover `assets`.
+   require(allowed >= previewWithdraw(assets), "ERC20: insufficient allowance");
      if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[account][msg.sender] = allowed - previewWithdraw(assets);
    }
  }
```
