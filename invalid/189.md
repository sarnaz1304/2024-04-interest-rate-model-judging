# Unable to clear bad debts in some certain cases

## Summary

Unable to clear bad debts in some certain cases where there is not enough earning to cover bad debts.

## Vulnerability Detail

In clearBadDebt(), money from earning accumulator will be used to cover bad debts. However, if earning accumulator does not have enough amount of token to cover bad debts, clearBadDebt() will simply revert. If this scenario happens, bad debts will be stuck in the protocol and create more negative impact.

## Impact
Bad debts, which are unable to be cleared, will drain more from other users' earnings in future. Thus, users will be incentive to withdraw as soon as possible, leading to a possible bank run.
