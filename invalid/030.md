# Missing return statement in edge case scenario in `FixedLib::calculateDeposit`

## Summary
Though improbable, the function `calculateDeposit` lacks a return statement for edge case scenarios in which `memBackupSupplied` equals zero. In such cases, the function completes without explicitly returning values, which could lead to unexpected behavior or revert due to the function's inability to return output according its specified return type (uint256 yield, uint256 backupFee)

## Vulnerability Detail
In solidity, functions that are expected to return values must explicitly do so for all execution paths., so if `memBackupSupplied` is 0, the function would exit without returning `yield` or `backupFee`, potentially leading to undefined behavior or transaction reverts. 

## Impact
This oversight can result in operational issues, particularly in contracts relying on this function for financial calculations.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the function returns appropriate values for all logical branches
