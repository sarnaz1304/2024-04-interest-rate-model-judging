# Users who Get liquidated Still remain in debt.

## Summary
Users who undergo liquidation continue to carry their debt, contrary to the expectation of being relieved of it.

## Vulnerability Detail
In an ideal scenario, when a user faces liquidation, they should have their debt cleared. However, users who undergo liquidation are still burdened with their debt

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that users who are liquidated will perpetually remain in debt..

### POC

```solidity
function testDebtAfterLiquidate() external {
    market.deposit(10 ether, address(this));
    marketWETH.deposit(10 ether, BOB);
    daiPriceFeed.setPrice(1e18);
    vm.startPrank(BOB);
    auditor.enterMarket(marketWETH);
    market.borrow(4 ether, BOB, BOB);
    vm.stopPrank();

   
    daiPriceFeed.setPrice(1e20); // note : this is also a bug from the contract in order for users to get liquidated..
    market.liquidate(BOB, 4 ether, marketWETH);
    assertEq(market.previewDebt(BOB), 3908181818181818181); // apx 4 ether

    daiPriceFeed.setPrice(1e18);
    marketWETH.deposit(20 ether, BOB);
 
    vm.prank(BOB);
    market.borrow(4 ether, BOB, BOB);
    daiPriceFeed.setPrice(1e20);
  
    market.liquidate(BOB, 10 ether, marketWETH);
    assertEq(market.previewDebt(BOB), 7724545454545454544); // apx 8 ether...

  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The system should be adjusted to ensure that users' debts are cleared following liquidation, aligning with standard expectations and practices.
