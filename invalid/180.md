# Lack of invoking the RewardsController#`handleDeposit()` inside the Market#`depositAtMaturity()`

## Summary

When the Market#`depositAtMaturity()` would be called by a depositor, the RewardsController#`handleDeposit()` is supposed to be called inside the Market#`depositAtMaturity()` to update the record of the depositor's rewarded deposit.

However, there is **no** logic to call the RewardsController#`handleDeposit()` inside the  Market#`depositAtMaturity()`.

This lead to the unexpected situation that the record of the depositor's rewarded deposit would be **not** updated -when the depositor would call the Market#`depositAtMaturity()`. 


## Vulnerability Detail

When a user would deposit a certain amount of the assets into a fixed (maturity) pool, the user would call the Market#`depositAtMaturity()` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L232-L272
```solidity
  /// @notice Deposits a certain amount to a maturity.
  /// @param maturity maturity date where the assets will be deposited.
  /// @param assets amount to receive from the msg.sender.
  /// @param minAssetsRequired minimum amount of assets required by the depositor for the transaction to be accepted.
  /// @param receiver address that will be able to withdraw the deposited assets.
  /// @return positionAssets total amount of assets (principal + fee) to be withdrawn at maturity.
  function depositAtMaturity(
    uint256 maturity,
    uint256 assets,
    uint256 minAssetsRequired,
    address receiver
  ) external whenNotPaused whenNotFrozen returns (uint256 positionAssets) {
    if (assets == 0) revert ZeroDeposit();
    // reverts on failure
    FixedLib.checkPoolState(maturity, maxFuturePools, FixedLib.State.VALID, FixedLib.State.NONE);

    FixedLib.Pool storage pool = fixedPools[maturity];

    uint256 backupEarnings = pool.accrueEarnings(maturity);
    floatingAssets += backupEarnings;

    (uint256 fee, uint256 backupFee) = pool.calculateDeposit(assets, backupFeeRate);
    positionAssets = assets + fee;
    if (positionAssets < minAssetsRequired) revert Disagreement();

    floatingBackupBorrowed -= pool.deposit(assets); 
    pool.unassignedEarnings -= fee + backupFee;
    earningsAccumulator += backupFee;

    // update account's position
    FixedLib.Position storage position = fixedDepositPositions[maturity][receiver];

    // if account doesn't have a current position, add it to the list
    if (position.principal == 0) {
      Account storage account = accounts[receiver];
      account.fixedDeposits = account.fixedDeposits.setMaturity(maturity);
    }

    position.principal += assets;
    position.fee += fee;

    emit DepositAtMaturity(maturity, msg.sender, receiver, assets, fee);
    emitMarketUpdate();
    emitFixedEarningsUpdate(maturity);

    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
  }
```

Within the RewardsController#`handleDeposit()`, the record of the rewarded deposit of the user (`account`), who deposited their asset into the fixed pool, would be updated like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/RewardsController.sol#L47-L60
```solidity
  /// @notice Hook to be called by the Market to update the index of the account that made a rewarded deposit.
  /// @dev There's no need to check that `msg.sender` is a valid Market as it won't have available rewards if it's not.
  /// @param account The account to which the index is updated.
  function handleDeposit(address account) external {
    Market market = Market(msg.sender);
    AccountOperation[] memory ops = new AccountOperation[](1);
    ops[0] = AccountOperation({ operation: false, balance: market.balanceOf(account) });

    Distribution storage dist = distribution[market];
    uint256 available = dist.availableRewardsCount;
    for (uint128 r = 0; r < available; ) {
      update(account, market, dist.availableRewards[r], ops);
      unchecked {
        ++r;
      }
    }
  }
```

When the Market#`depositAtMaturity()` would be called by a depositor, the RewardsController#`handleDeposit()` is supposed to be called inside the Market#`depositAtMaturity()` to update the record of the depositor's rewarded deposit.

However, there is **no** logic to call the RewardsController#`handleDeposit()` inside the  Market#`depositAtMaturity()`.


## Impact

This lead to the unexpected situation that the record of the depositor's rewarded deposit would **not** be updated -when the depositor would call the Market#`depositAtMaturity()`.

## Recommendation
Within the Market#`depositAtMaturity()`, consider invoking the RewardsController#`handleDeposit()` like this:
```diff
  function depositAtMaturity(
    uint256 maturity,
    uint256 assets,
    uint256 minAssetsRequired,
    address receiver
  ) external whenNotPaused whenNotFrozen returns (uint256 positionAssets) {
+   handleDeposit(msg.sender);
   ...
```
