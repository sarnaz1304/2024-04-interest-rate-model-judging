# Undercollateralized positions can be liquidated when the contract is frozen

## Summary

Undercollateralized positions can be liquidated when the contract is frozen.

## Vulnerability Detail

User can not deposit collateral when the contract is `frozen` since the `depsoit` functions use the `whenNotFrozen` modifier. 

But if the user is undercollateralized when the contract is frozen then he can get liquidated since the `liqudiate` function does not use the `whenNotFrozen` modifier.

## Impact

Hence only way to make a position healthy is by `repaying` the debt. During the `repayment` the user will have to make the `interest payment` which is an additional burden on the user at the time of the transaction. Which means he needs extra funds to make the repayment. If he is allowed to add on to his collateral then there is no such additional cost (in the form of an interest) on the user to make his position healthy again.

## Tool used

Manual Review and VSCode

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to have `deposit`, `repay` and `liquidate` live at the same time without any deviation of their operating times among themselves.
