# Failure to Update floatingBackupBorrowed Variable in Market.sol Borrow Function

## Summary

The `borrow` function in the `Market.sol` contract contains a vulnerability where the `floatingBackupBorrowed` variable is not updated, potentially allowing users to borrow above the intended limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `borrow` function in `Market.sol` checks if the underlying liquidity that the account wants to withdraw is borrowed, but it fails to update the `floatingBackupBorrowed` variable. This oversight can lead to incorrect calculations of available liquidity, potentially allowing users to borrow beyond the intended limit.

without updating `floatingBackupBorrowed` the above will always pass, as `floatingBackupBorrowed` will always be zero

## Impact

Failure to update the `floatingBackupBorrowed` variable in the `borrow` function can result in users borrowing above the specified limit, which may lead to liquidity shortages and other unintended consequences within the protocol. Also everywhere this variable is used to check contracts liquidity will be wrongly checked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `borrow` function in `Market.sol` to ensure that the `floatingBackupBorrowed` variable is properly updated whenever new debt is added. This can be achieved by incorporating the logic used in the `borrowAtMaturity` function, where the `floatingBackupBorrowed` variable is correctly updated after each borrow operation. By ensuring that `floatingBackupBorrowed` reflects the correct state of borrowed funds, the protocol can accurately assess available liquidity and prevent users from borrowing beyond the intended limit.
