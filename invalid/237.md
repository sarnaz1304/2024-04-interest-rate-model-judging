# Race condition between 2 different markets in bad debt situation

## Summary

In case of bad debt the first market to liquidate would get a bigger share of the liquidated assets, rather than spreading it equally between markets.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenario:
* Bob has debt both in DAI and USDC market, and collateral in ETH market
* ETH price goes so low that Bob isn't only liquidated but also has bad debt

Under this situation, how is the bad debt spread out?
Well, it depends on which market `liquidate()` is called first.
The first market to liquidate would get more of the liquidated assets.

This doesn't seem like a reasonable and fair way to spread the liquidation assets.
It seems reasonable that in the case that a user is liquidated every market would get a fair share of the liquidation assets.

## Impact
Markets don't get a fair share of the liquidation assets in case of bad debt.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In case of bad debt, spread the liquidation across the markets which lent the user (that would probably require adding another variable to keep tabs on how many assets every market received)
