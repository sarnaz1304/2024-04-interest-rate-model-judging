# Auditor.sol support spot price oracles, which could expose protocol to risk of price manipulation attacks

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Under the file `protocol/contracts/PriceFeedPool.sol` the PriceFeedPool class is implemented and it also could be used to derive the price of an asset by calling its `latestAnswer()` function.

The `latestAnswer()` function however derives the asset price according to the pool token reserves.

Relying only on the reserves of the pool, to derive the price is really dangerous, as it allows the attacker to take flash loans to manipulate the reserves ratio momentarily (in the same transaction) and exploit the price manipulation to do damage to the exactly protocol.

## Impact
`Auditor.sol` is supporting spot price Oracle from UniswapV2 liquidity pool, which is very vulnerable to flashloan price manipulation. Hacker can use flashloan to distort the price and perform malicious liqudiation  by overvaluing their debt and undervaluing their collateral or to steal value directly from pool by borrowing more than the attacker collateral is worth.

```solidity
function latestAnswer() external view returns (int256) {
    int256 mainPrice = basePriceFeed.latestAnswer();
    (uint256 reserve0, uint256 reserve1, ) = pool.getReserves();
    return
    
    // @audit-issue spot price oracle => possible manipulation
      int256(
        token1Based
          ? uint256(mainPrice).mulDivDown((reserve1 * baseUnit0) / reserve0, baseUnit1)
          : uint256(mainPrice).mulDivDown((reserve0 * baseUnit1) / reserve1, baseUnit0)
      );
  }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of relying on spot price of AMMs like UNIV2, we recommend relying on TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) oracles with a sufficient time window to derive the price. (As it is the case for Uniswap V3)
