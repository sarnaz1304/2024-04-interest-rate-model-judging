# Auditor::enableMarket() has no check to ensure that number of markets is below uint8 maximum

## Summary

When new markets are enabled in `Auditor::enableMarket()` there is no check to ensure that the number of enabled markets is not above 256. There is a dev comment on the function, however there should still be a check within the function to avoid overflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

The comment on [Auditor::enableMarket()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L339-L367) states that there will be overflow if there are more than 256 markets enabled:
```solidity
  /// @notice Enables a certain market.
  /// @dev Enabling more than 256 markets will cause an overflow when casting market index to uint8.
  /// @param market market to add to the protocol.
  /// @param priceFeed address of Chainlink's Price Feed aggregator used to query the asset price in base.
  /// @param adjustFactor market's adjust factor for the underlying asset.
  function enableMarket(
    Market market,
    IPriceFeed priceFeed,
    uint128 adjustFactor
  ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (market.auditor() != this) revert AuditorMismatch(); // @audit only place in contract where auditor() is checked?
    if (markets[market].isListed) revert MarketAlreadyListed();
    if (address(priceFeed) != BASE_FEED && priceFeed.decimals() != priceDecimals) revert InvalidPriceFeed();

    uint8 decimals = market.decimals();
    markets[market] = MarketData({
      isListed: true,
      adjustFactor: adjustFactor,
      decimals: decimals,
      index: uint8(marketList.length),
      priceFeed: priceFeed
    });

    marketList.push(market);

    emit MarketListed(market, decimals);
    emit PriceFeedSet(market, priceFeed);
    emit AdjustFactorSet(market, adjustFactor);
  }
```
However the function has no check to ensure that this not happen. Meaning that it is possible to enable too many markets, causing markets enabled after the maximum of 256 to have their index overflow when cast to uint8.

## Impact

If more than 256 markets are enabled, the newest market's index when cast to `uint8` will silently overflow. This will cause 2 markets to have the same index, which will lead to incorrect market data bring retrieved for the new market, an example:
The 260th market will have their index cast to `4`, meaning when using the stored index, data about the `4th` market will be retrieved, which is incorrect.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a require check when adding new market, ensuring that the number of markets in `marketList` is below 256.
