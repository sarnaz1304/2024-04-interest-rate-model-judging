# During a market pause, unhealthy users are treated differently depending on the amount of collateral they have in other markets.

## Summary
During a market pause, two unhealthy users with same collateral ratio, but different amount of collateral in the paused market are penalized differently.
For the liquidatable user(UserA) to escape liquidation, he has to deposit more collateral to unpaused markets.
This can also be done by UserB, so he has no excuse for having a liquidatable position.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `seizeAssets` function has a whenNotPaused modifier, which prevents seizing collaterals within that market when it is paused.

Suppose there are two unhealthy users with same collateralRatio of say 100% while a market(MarketUSDC) is paused:

- User1 has debt of $100 usdc in MarketUSDC, and collateral of $100 weth in MarketWETH
- User2 has debt of $100 usdc in MarketUSDC, and collateral of $80 USDC in MarketUSDC, and collateral of $20 USDC in MarketWETH
- User3 has debt of $100 usdc in MarketUSDC, and collateral of $100 usdc in MaketUSDC.

Despite the fact that they have the same position health, if they get liquidated:

- Up to $100 can be liquidated from User1
- Only $20 can be liquidated from User2
- $0 can be liquidated from User3

Note that there's only one way for User1 to escape liquidation namely: adding more collateral to another Market(MarketWETH), which can also be done by User2 and User3, but still their punishments vary.
Even though User 2 and User 3 have NO EXCUSE in having a liquidatable position (as they can add collateral to other market), they don't get penalized.

## Impact
Liquidatable users aren't penalized equally, even though they can both follow the same procedure to make their position healthy again. This could lead to accrual of bad debt.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since users having collateral in other markets can get liquidated based on debt value in paused market, `seizeAssets` should be active when market is paused.
If protocol really needs to halt `seizeAssets` function, `whenNotFrozen` modifier may be used.
