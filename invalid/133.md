# Within the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`, the WETH-withdrawn via the Market#`withdraw()` would be stuck inside the MarketETHRouter contract due to the `unwrap()` modifier

## Summary

Within the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`, the MarketETHRouter#`unwrapAndTransfer()` is supposed to be called **after** the Market#`withdraw()` would be called to transfer WETH-withdrawn from the given Market via the Market#`withdraw()` to the depositor (`msg.sender`). 

However, within the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`, the MarketETHRouter#`unwrapAndTransfer()` would be called via the `unwrap()` modifier **before** the Market#`withdraw()` would be called.
This is because the modifier would basically be called **before** the internal functions. Hence, within the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`, the `unwrap()` modifier would be called **before** the Market#`withdraw()` would be called.

This is problematic. Because, when the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()` would be called, WETH-withdrawn from the given Market via the Market#`withdraw()` would be remained inside the MarketETHRouter contract without transferring to the depositor (`msg.sender`).

This lead that the underlying (WETH) of the depositor (`msg.sender`) will be stuck forever inside the MarketETHRouter - when the depositor (`msg.sender`) would call the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`. 


## Vulnerability Detail

Within the MarketETHRouter contract, the `unwrap()` modifier would be defined.

Within the `unwrap()` modifier, the MarketETHRouter#`unwrapAndTransfer()` would be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/MarketETHRouter.sol#L25
```solidity
  modifier unwrap(uint256 assets) {
    _;
    unwrapAndTransfer(assets);  ///<--------------- @audit
  }
```

Within the MarketETHRouter#`unwrapAndTransfer()`, WETH#`withdraw()` would be called.
Then, the amount (`assets`) of Native ETH would be transferred to the caller (`msg.sender`) via the `safeTransferETH()`  like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/MarketETHRouter.sol#L145-L146
```solidity
  function unwrapAndTransfer(uint256 assets) internal {
    weth.withdraw(assets); ///<--------------- @audit
    msg.sender.safeTransferETH(assets); ///<--------------- @audit
  }
```

Within the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`, the `unwrap()` modifier would be called first.
Then, the Market#`withdraw()` would be called to withdraw WETH from the floating pool to the MarketETHRouter contract (`address(this)`) like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/MarketETHRouter.sol#L57-L58
```solidity
  /// @notice Unwraps WETH from the floating pool and withdraws to caller.
  /// @param assets amount of assets to withdraw.
  /// @return shares number of burned shares.
  function withdraw(uint256 assets) external unwrap(assets) returns (uint256 shares) {  ///<--------------- @audit
    return market.withdraw(assets, address(this), msg.sender); ///<--------------- @audit
  }
```

Within the Market#`withdraw()`, a given amount (`assets`) of the underlying (WETH) would be withdrawn to a given `receiver` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L729
```solidity
  /// @notice Withdraws the owner's floating pool assets to the receiver address.  
  /// @dev Makes sure that the owner doesn't have shortfall after withdrawing.
  /// @param assets amount of underlying to be withdrawn.
  /// @param receiver address to which the assets will be transferred.
  /// @param owner address which owns the floating pool assets.
  /// @return shares amount of shares redeemed for underlying asset.
  function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public override returns (uint256 shares) {
    ...
    shares = super.withdraw(assets, receiver, owner);  ///<--------------- @audit
    ...
  }
```

Within the  MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`, the MarketETHRouter#`unwrapAndTransfer()` is supposed to be called **after** the Market#`withdraw()` would be called to transfer WETH-withdrawn from the given Market via the Market#`withdraw()` to the depositor (`msg.sender`). 

However, within the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`, the MarketETHRouter#`unwrapAndTransfer()` would be called via the `unwrap()` modifier **before** the Market#`withdraw()` would be called.
This is because the modifier would basically be called **before** the internal functions. Hence, within the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`, the `unwrap()` modifier would be called **before** the Market#`withdraw()` would be called.

This is problematic. Because, when the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()` would be called, WETH-withdrawn from the given Market via the Market#`withdraw()` would be remained inside the MarketETHRouter contract without transferring to the depositor (`msg.sender`).


## Impact

This lead that the underlying (WETH) of the depositor (`msg.sender`) will be stuck forever inside the MarketETHRouter - when the depositor (`msg.sender`) would call the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`.

## Recommendation

Within the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()`, consider calling the MarketETHRouter#`unwrapAndTransfer()` - **after** the Market#`withdraw()` would be called. 
Also, consider removing the `unwrap()` from the MarketETHRouter#`withdraw()` like this:
```diff
+ function withdraw(uint256 assets) external returns (uint256 shares) { 
- function withdraw(uint256 assets) external unwrap(assets) returns (uint256 shares) { 
    return market.withdraw(assets, address(this), msg.sender); 
+   unwrapAndTransfer(assets); 
  }
```
