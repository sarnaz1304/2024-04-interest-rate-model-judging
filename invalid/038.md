# [M-11] `InterestRateModel.sol` & `Market.sol`- `Days` Time Units Can Lead to Overflow

## Summary

The protocol uses time units like days in `InterestRateModel.sol` and `Market.sol` . While using time units can improve code readability, it is essential to ensure that the correct time units are used consistently throughout the contract and that the values being multiplied or divided by time units are within safe ranges to prevent overflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `InterestRateModel.sol` the contract uses `days` here:
```javascript 
      ).mulDivDown(maturity - block.timestamp, 365 days);
```
In `Market.sol` the contract uses `days` here:
```javascript 
      fee = assets.mulWadDown(fixedRate.mulDivDown(maturity - block.timestamp, 365 days));
```
```javascript
      assetsDiscounted = positionAssets.divWadDown(1e18 + fixedRate.mulDivDown(maturity - block.timestamp, 365 days));
```
```javascript
        .mulDivDown(block.timestamp - lastFloatingDebtUpdate, 365 days) (line 895)
```
```javascript
        .mulDivDown(block.timestamp - lastFloatingDebtUpdate, 365 days) (line917)
```

## Impact

The use of time units like days in the `InterestRateModel` and `Market` contracts of this protocol can lead to overflow issues, causing significant disruption to its functionality and potentially resulting in financial losses. Overflow can corrupt the protocol's state, leading to incorrect interest rate calculations, improper debt accounting, and inaccurate market balances.

In the `InterestRateModel` contract, overflow can affect the calculation of fixed and floating interest rates, drastically impacting borrowing and lending dynamics. In the `Market` contract, overflow can disrupt the calculation of accrued interest, resulting in unfair distribution of funds and incorrect debt balances.

The overflow can propagate throughout the protocol, affecting liquidity calculations, collateral management, and overall market health. In severe cases, it can lead to a complete breakdown of the protocol, rendering it unusable and causing significant financial harm to users. The lack of proper range checks and overflow prevention measures makes the protocol vulnerable, undermining its stability and reliability.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement proper range checks and input validation to ensure that the values being multiplied or divided by time units are within safe ranges. Consider using smaller time units (e.g., seconds instead of days) to reduce the risk of overflow.
