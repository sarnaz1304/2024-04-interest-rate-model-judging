# [M-15] Unbounded Loop in `Auditor::handleBadDebt` can lead to Denial of Service Attacks and Gas Consumption

## Summary

The `handleBadDebt` function in the `Auditor` contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by entering a large number of markets and repeatedly calling the `handleBadDebt` function, causing excessive gas consumption and potentially disrupting the protocol's functionality.

The `handleBadDebt` function iterates over all the markets that an account has entered and performs calculations and external calls for each market, even if the account has no collateral in those markets. This unbounded iteration can lead to significant gas consumption if an attacker enters a large number of markets.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is the function `handleBadDebt`:
```javascript
function handleBadDebt(address account) external {
    uint256 memMarketMap = accountMarkets[account];
    uint256 marketMap = memMarketMap;
    for (uint256 i = 0; marketMap != 0; marketMap >>= 1) {
      if (marketMap & 1 != 0) {
        Market market = marketList[i];
        MarketData storage m = markets[market];
        uint256 assets = market.maxWithdraw(account);
        if (assets.mulDivDown(assetPrice(m.priceFeed), 10 ** m.decimals).mulWadDown(m.adjustFactor) > 0) return;
      }
      unchecked {
        ++i;
      }
    }

    marketMap = memMarketMap;
    for (uint256 i = 0; marketMap != 0; marketMap >>= 1) {
      if (marketMap & 1 != 0) marketList[i].clearBadDebt(account);
      unchecked {
        ++i;
      }
    }
  }
```

Here is a test case proving the DoS vulnerability in the `handleBadDebt` function:

Add this test to `Market.t.sol`:

```javascript
function testHandleBadDebtDoS() external {
    // Enter a large number of markets for the attacker
    uint256 numMarkets = 1000;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numMarkets; i++) {
        Market newMarket = Market(address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(new Market(weth, auditor)), "")));
        newMarket.initialize(
            string(abi.encodePacked("Market", i)),
            12,
            1e18,
            InterestRateModel(address(irm)),
            0.02e18 / uint256(1 days),
            1e17,
            0,
            0.0046e18,
            0.42e18
        );
        auditor.enableMarket(newMarket, IPriceFeed(auditor.BASE_FEED()), 0.9e18);
        auditor.enterMarket(newMarket);
    }

    // Simulate the attacker repeatedly calling handleBadDebt
    uint256 numCalls = 100;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numCalls; i++) {
        vm.prank(address(auditor));
        auditor.handleBadDebt(address(this));
    }

    // Assert that the repeated calls consumed a significant amount of gas
    uint256 gasUsed = gasleft();
    assertTrue(gasUsed > 1000000); // Adjust the gas threshold as needed
}
```
Run this test with `forge test --mt testHandleBadDebtDoS`

In this test case:

The attacker enters a large number of markets. The attacker repeatedly calls the handleBadDebt function (e.g., 100 times) with their own address.
The test asserts that the repeated calls consumed a significant amount of gas, indicating the potential for a DoS attack.


## Impact

The DoS vulnerability in the `handleBadDebt` function can have the following impacts on the protocol:

Excessive Gas Consumption: Repeated calls to `handleBadDebt` with a large number of markets can consume a substantial amount of gas, leading to high transaction costs and potential gas limit issues.

Denial of Service: If the attacker's transactions consume a significant portion of the available gas, it can prevent other legitimate transactions from being processed, effectively causing a DoS situation and disrupting the protocol's operations.

Degraded Performance: Even if the attacker's transactions don't completely block other transactions, the excessive gas consumption can slow down the protocol's operations and degrade its overall performance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid unbounded loops and limit the number of iterations based on gas constraints. Here are two possible approaches, you can do one of the following:

Implement a gas limit or a maximum number of markets that can be processed in a single call to `handleBadDebt` to prevent excessive gas consumption.

Introduce rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to limit the frequency at which an account can call the `handleBadDebt` function.

Implement pagination or batching: Instead of processing all markets in a single transaction, break the loop into smaller batches and process them separately. This can be achieved by introducing a limit parameter and an offset or cursor to keep track of the progress.

Consider alternative designs: Evaluate if the current design of iterating over all markets is necessary or if there are alternative approaches that can achieve the same goal without the need for an unbounded loop.
