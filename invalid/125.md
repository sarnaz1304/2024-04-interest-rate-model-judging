# Market Index Limited to 256 Entries Due to uint8 Casting (Scalability Limitation)

## Summary
The smart contract uses a uint8 type for market indices, which inherently limits the number of markets that can be indexed to 256.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `enableMarket` function, when a new market is added, its index is set by casting the current length of the `marketList` array to a uint8. This imposes an artificial ceiling on system expansion since uint8 can only represent values from 0-255.
## Impact
This design choice restricts future scalability. If more than 255 markets are ever needed, this would require significant refactoring and could disrupt platform operations if not anticipated beforehand.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
@>     markets[market] = MarketData({
                isListed: true,
               adjustFactor: adjustFactor,
               decimals: decimals,
@>         index: uint8(marketList.length),
              priceFeed: priceFeed
```

## Proof of concept
### Test Case
```javascript
// Pseudocode test case example:
it('should fail when adding more than 255 markets', async () => {
   const MAX_MARKETS = /* derived from data type limitation */;
   
   try {
       // Simulate adding up until limit reached.
       for(let i=0; i<=MAX_MARKETS; ++i){
           await contractInstance.enableMarket(/* parameters */);
       }
       
      assert.fail("Expected error did not occur");
     } catch(error){
         assert.include(error.message,"revert", "Did not revert on exceeding max market count");
     }
});
```
### Logs
```javascript
// In JavaScript testing environment pseudocode:

contract.on('Error', (error) => { console.log(`Error occurred: ${error}`); });
```
## Recommendation
Change data types as necessary in both storage structures and logic handling indexing:
```solidity
struct MarketData{
    //...existing fields...
    unit16 index;
}

function enableMarket(
     Market market,
      IPriceFeed pricefeed_,
        uint128 adjustFactor_
 ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE){
     
     require(marketlist.lenght <type(unit16).max,"Exceeds maximum number of markets");

      markets[market]=Marketdata({
          /..existing fields../..
          index:uint16(marketlist.length)
});

}
```
