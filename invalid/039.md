# [H-3] `RewardsController.sol` - Any Admin Can Withdraw/Drain/Rug-Pull Any ERC20 Token from RewardsController

## Summary

The `RewardsController` contract has a `withdraw` function that allows any account with the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to withdraw any ERC20 token balance from the contract. This function does not have any restrictions or checks on the amount or the specific ERC20 tokens that can be withdrawn.

## Vulnerability Detail
`RewardsController.sol`:
```javascript 
function withdraw(ERC20 asset, address to) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    asset.safeTransfer(to, asset.balanceOf(address(this)));
  }
```
## Impact
Any admin of the `RewardsController` contract has the ability to withdraw any ERC20 token balance from the contract, potentially stealing user funds or other assets that are meant to be held by the contract. This vulnerability can lead to a complete loss of trust in the protocol and significant financial losses for users who have deposited their assets into the `RewardsController` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do at least one of the following:

Allow access to only the relevant parts of protocol funds, e.g. by tracking fees internally. Forcing a timelock on the admin actions can be another mitigation.

Implement additional access control mechanisms, such as requiring multiple signatures or time-locks, to prevent a single admin from unilaterally withdrawing assets.

Consider implementing a governance mechanism where token holders can vote on the allocation and withdrawal of assets from the RewardsController contract.
