# Lack of explicit verification that the total WETH balance is sufficient to cover the withdrawal request in `InstallmentsRouter::borrowETH`

## Summary
in `InstallmentsRouter::borrowETH`, there is no verification that the wETH balance is big enough to cover teh withdrawal request.

## Vulnerability Detail
The borrowETH function integrates the WETH contract to facilitate the conversion of WETH (Wrapped Ether) to ETH. This function borrows WETH from a market, then calls the withdraw method on the WETH contract to unwrap the WETH into ETH, which is then sent to the caller. However there is no check that the withdrawal request can be fulfilled as there is no verification that the weth balance is sufficient.

## Impact
Lack of balance checks before withdrawal may lead to failed transactions if the WETH balance is lower than expected, wasting gas and possibly disrupting intended contract flow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing checks to confirm that the contract's WETH balance matches the expected amount post-borrowing but pre-withdrawal.
```diff
+require(weth.balanceOf(address(this)) >= totalAmount, "Insufficient WETH balance after borrowing");
```
