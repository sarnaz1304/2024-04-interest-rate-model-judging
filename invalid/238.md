# collateralization ratio of 1:1 will cause insolvency  during Auditor::exitMarket()

## Summary

If collateral < debt, even at 100% collateralization, insolvency risk exists due to  market volatility or asset devaluation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The checkShortfall function in the exitMarket function may allow insolvency if collateral is less than debt.

## Impact
Potential risk of insolvency despite 100% collateralization, exposing users to loss in market volatility.
It will lead to DOS and user not being able to exit. 


## Code Snippet


```soildity
  function exitMarket(Market market) external {
    MarketData storage m = markets[market];
    if (!m.isListed) revert MarketNotListed();

    (uint256 assets, uint256 debt) = market.accountSnapshot(msg.sender);

    // fail if the sender has a borrow balance
    if (debt != 0) revert RemainingDebt();

    // fail if the sender is not permitted to redeem all of their assets
    checkShortfall(market, msg.sender, assets);

    uint256 marketMap = accountMarkets[msg.sender];
    uint256 marketMask = 1 << m.index;

    if ((marketMap & marketMask) == 0) return;
    accountMarkets[msg.sender] = marketMap & ~marketMask;

    emit MarketExited(market, msg.sender);
  }

 function checkShortfall(Market market, address account, uint256 amount) public view {
    // if the account is not 'in' the market, bypass the liquidity check
    if ((accountMarkets[account] & (1 << markets[market].index)) == 0) return;

    // otherwise, perform a hypothetical liquidity check to guard against shortfall
    (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = accountLiquidity(account, market, amount);
    if (collateral < debt) revert InsufficientAccountLiquidity();
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure collateralization ratios are set to provide ample buffer against debt to mitigate insolvency risks.
