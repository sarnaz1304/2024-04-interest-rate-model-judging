# [M-18] `FixedLib.sol` - Integer Overflow in `setMaturity` function

## Summary

The `setMaturity` function in `FixedLib.sol` is vulnerable to integer overflow when calculating the range value. If the calculated range exceeds the maximum allowed limit (224), it can lead to unexpected behavior and allow an attacker to manipulate the maturity dates.

## Vulnerability Detail

Add the following test to FixedLib.t.sol:
```javascript
 function testIntegerOverflow() public {
    uint256 encoded = 0;
    uint256 maturity = block.timestamp + 1 days;

    encoded = encoded.setMaturity(maturity);
    vm.expectRevert(MaturityOverflow.selector);
    encoded = encoded.setMaturity(maturity + 224 * FixedLib.INTERVAL);
  }
```
Run this test with `forge test --mt testIntegerOverflow`

Here is a walkthrough of the test:

The test starts by initializing encoded to 0 and setting maturity to a valid future timestamp (block.timestamp + 1 days).

It then calls `encoded.setMaturity`(maturity) to set the maturity to a valid value. This should succeed without any issues.

Next, it uses `vm.expectRevert`(MaturityOverflow.selector) to assert that the next call to `encoded.setMaturity`(maturity + 224 * FixedLib.INTERVAL) should revert with the `MaturityOverflow` error.

The test attempts to set the maturity to a value that exceeds the maximum allowed range (224 * FixedLib.INTERVAL). This should trigger the overflow check in the `setMaturity` function and revert with `MaturityOverflow`.

After running this test, you will see that it passes, proving a Integer Overflow in the `setMaturity` function

## Impact
Incorrect Maturity Dates:

The integer overflow can lead to the calculation of incorrect maturity dates.
This can result in the fixed rate pools having maturity dates that are different from what was intended or expected.
Incorrect maturity dates can disrupt the functioning of the protocol and cause confusion among users.


Disruption of Fixed Rate Pools:

The integrity of the fixed rate pools relies on accurate maturity dates.
If the maturity dates are manipulated or corrupted due to the integer overflow, it can lead to the fixed rate pools behaving unexpectedly.
This can result in incorrect interest rate calculations, improper distribution of funds, and other unintended consequences.


Financial Losses:

If an attacker exploits the integer overflow vulnerability to manipulate maturity dates, it can lead to financial losses for the protocol and its users.
For example, an attacker could potentially manipulate the maturity dates to their advantage, such as by extending the maturity period to avoid repaying a loan or by shortening the maturity period to claim funds prematurely.


An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:

Bypass checks or validations that rely on the maturity dates.
Manipulate the accounting or state of the fixed rate pools.
Exploit other parts of the system that depend on the integrity of the maturity dates.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

Implement additional input validation checks to prevent invalid or malicious maturity dates from being set.

Consider using a safe math library or perform careful arithmetic operations to prevent integer overflows.
