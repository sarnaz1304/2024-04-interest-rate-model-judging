# The Market#`spendAllowance()` does not work properly when the Market#`borrow()` would be called via the MarketETHRouter#`borrow()` - due to lack of validation

## Summary

The Market#`spendAllowance()` would be called in the Market#`borrow()`.

However, the Market#`spendAllowance()` does not work properly when the Market#`borrow()` would be called via the MarketETHRouter#`borrow()` - due to lack of validation.


## Vulnerability Detail

Within the MarketETHRouter#`borrow()`, the Market#`borrow()` would be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/MarketETHRouter.sol#L73
```solidity
  /// @notice Unwraps WETH from the floating pool and borrows to caller.
  /// @param assets amount of assets to borrow.
  /// @return borrowShares number of borrowed shares.
  function borrow(uint256 assets) external unwrap(assets) returns (uint256 borrowShares) {
    return market.borrow(assets, address(this), msg.sender);  ///<------------- @audit 
  }
```

Within the Market#`borrow()`, the Market#`spendAllowance()` would be called with a given `borrower` and `assets` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L145
```solidity
  /// @notice Borrows a certain amount from the floating pool.
  /// @param assets amount to be sent to receiver and repaid by borrower.
  /// @param receiver address that will receive the borrowed assets.
  /// @param borrower address that will repay the borrowed assets.
  /// @return borrowShares shares corresponding to the borrowed assets.
  function borrow(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address borrower
  ) external whenNotPaused whenNotFrozen returns (uint256 borrowShares) {
    spendAllowance(borrower, assets); ///<---------- @audit 
    ...
```


Within the Market#`spendAllowance()`, if the caller (`msg.sender`) and a given `account` would be different, the caller (`msg.sender`)'s allowance over `account`'s assets would be checked and updated like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L982-L985
```solidity
  /// @notice Checks msg.sender's allowance over account's assets.
  /// @param account account in which the allowance will be checked.
  /// @param assets assets from account that msg.sender wants to operate on.
  function spendAllowance(address account, uint256 assets) internal {
    if (msg.sender != account) {  ///<-------@audit
      uint256 allowed = allowance[account][msg.sender]; // saves gas for limited approvals.ã€€///<-------@audit

      if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[account][msg.sender] = allowed - previewWithdraw(assets); ///<-------@audit
    }
  }
```

When a borrower would call the MarketETHRouter#`borrow()`, the caller (`msg.sender`) and the `account` of the Market#`spendAllowance()`, which is called in the Market#`borrow()` would be like this:
- The caller (`msg.sender`) would be the MarketETHRouter contract.
- The `account` would be the borrower.

In this case, within the Market#`spendAllowance()`, the `previewWithdraw(assets)` is supposed to be equal to or less than the `allowed` - if `allowed != type(uint256).max`:
```solidity
If (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[account][msg.sender] = allowed - previewWithdraw(assets);
```

However, within the Market#`spendAllowance()`, since there is **no** validation to check whether or not a given `assets` would exceed the `allowed` (if `allowed != type(uint256).max`), 

Hence, this allow the MarketETHRouter contract (`msg.sender`) to call the Market#`borrow()` with the amount (`assets`) of the asset, which is **more than** the amount of the shares-allowed. 

This means that the Market#`spendAllowance()` does **not** work properly.

**NOTE:**
By the way, the **same** situation would happen when the following situations: 
- when the [Market#`borrowAtMaturity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L327) would be called via the [MarketETHRouter#`borrowAtMaturity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L131).
- when the [Market#`withdrawAtMaturity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L411) would be called via the [MarketETHRouter#`withdrawAtMaturity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L117).


## Example scenario

Let's say Alice is a borrower.
- 1/ Alice would approve the MarketETHRouter contract to use `10` shares.
   - At this point, `allowance[MarketETHRouter contract][Alice] == 10 shares`. 

- 2/ Alice would call the MarketETHRouter#`borrow()` with the amount (`assets`) of the asset, which is worth `100` shares. 
   - At this point, the `allowed` in the Market#`spendAllowance()`, which is called inside the Market#`borrow()`, would be `allowance[MarketETHRouter contract][Alice] == 10 shares`.
   - In this case, the `allowed` (10 shares) is smaller than  the `previewWithdraw(assets)` (100 shares).
   - Hence, her TX of the MarketETHRouter#`borrow()` is supposed to be reverted.
```solidity
If (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[account][msg.sender] = allowed - previewWithdraw(assets);
``` 

- 3/ However, since there is **no** validation to check whether or not a given `assets` would exceed the `allowed`, Alice's TX of the MarketETHRouter#`borrow()` would be successful. 
   - As a result, she can borrow the amount (`assets`) of the asset, which is worth `100` shares - despite she approved the MarketETHRouter contract to use **only** `10` shares.

This means that the Market#`spendAllowance()` does **not** work properly.

**NOTE:**
By the way, the **same** situation would happen when the following situations: 
- when the [Market#`borrowAtMaturity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L327) would be called via the [MarketETHRouter#`borrowAtMaturity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L131).
- when the [Market#`withdrawAtMaturity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L411) would be called via the [MarketETHRouter#`withdrawAtMaturity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L117).


## Impact
A borrower can borrow the amount of the asset, which is more than worth amount of the shares-allowed.
This means that the Market#`spendAllowance()` does **not** work properly.

## Tool used
- Manual Review


## Recommendation

Within the Market#`spendAllowance()`, consider adding a validation to check whether or not a given `assets` would equal to or less than the `allowed` (if `allowed != type(uint256).max`) like this:
```diff
  function spendAllowance(address account, uint256 assets) internal {
    if (msg.sender != account) {
      uint256 allowed = allowance[account][msg.sender]; // saves gas for limited approvals.

+     if (allowed != type(uint256).max) require(allowed >= previewWithdraw(assets), "The previewWithdraw(assets) must be equal to or less than the allowed");
      if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[account][msg.sender] = allowed - previewWithdraw(assets);
    }
  }
```
