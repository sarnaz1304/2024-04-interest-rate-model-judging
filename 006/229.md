# Anyone can allow others' assets to be used as collateral without approval of the asset owner because the `Market.borrow` function doesn't check if `assets > 0`

## Summary

The [Market.borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L140) function doesn't check if `assets > 0`, so anyone can call this function with `assets = 0`.
In this function, it calls [auditor.checkBorrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L154) function which changes the `accountMarkets[borrower]` variable.
As a result, anyone can allow others' assets to be used as collateral without approval of the asset owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Market.borrow` function doesn't check if `assets > 0`, so anybody can call this function with `assets = 0`.

```Solodity
File: protocol\contracts\Market.sol
140:   function borrow(
141:     uint256 assets,
142:     address receiver,
143:     address borrower
144:   ) external whenNotPaused whenNotFrozen returns (uint256 borrowShares) {
145:     spendAllowance(borrower, assets);
         [...]
167:     auditor.checkBorrow(this, borrower);
168:     asset.safeTransfer(receiver, assets);
169:   }
```

From L167, it calls [auditor.checkBorrow] function, which changes the `accountMarkets[borrower]` variable.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L154

```Solodity
File: protocol\contracts\Auditor.sol
154:   function checkBorrow(Market market, address borrower) external {
155:     MarketData storage m = markets[market];
156:     if (!m.isListed) revert MarketNotListed();
157: 
158:     uint256 marketMap = accountMarkets[borrower];
159:     uint256 marketMask = 1 << m.index;
160: 
161:     // validate borrow state
162:     if ((marketMap & marketMask) == 0) {
163:       // only markets may call checkBorrow if borrower not in market
164:       if (msg.sender != address(market)) revert NotMarket();
165: 
166:       accountMarkets[borrower] = marketMap | marketMask;
167:       emit MarketEntered(market, borrower);
168:     }
169: 
170:     // verify that current liquidity is not short
171:     (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = accountLiquidity(borrower, Market(address(0)), 0);
172:     if (collateral < debt) revert InsufficientAccountLiquidity();
173:   }
```

From L166, `accountMarkets[borrower]` is changed to allow the assets of the market to be used as collateral for borrowing other assets.

As a result, anyone can allow others' assets to be used as collateral without approval of the asset owner.

### Example

Let's assume Alice decides to only use the `DAI` market for depositing and withdrawing, and use other markets freely.

- She can earn yield from `DAI` market by depositing assets.
- She belives the assets of `DAI` market will never be used as collateral as long as she calls [enterMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L63) function for that market.
- If Alice's adjusted amount of collateral is less than her adjusted amount of debt, she belives her position will only be liquidated for the other markets, not for `DAI` market.
However, someone else can allow the assets of the `DAI` market to be used as collateral for Alice's positions by calling the `DAI` market's `borrow` function with Alice's address as `borrower` parameter.
As a result, the assets of the `DAI` market may also be liquidated without Alice's approval.

## Impact

Anyone can allow others' assets to be used as collateral without the approval of the asset owner.
As a result, it can cause the loss of funds to the user.
