# [M-10] `InterestRateModel.sol` - Forced Type Casting Can Lead to Overflow/Underflow and Unexpected Behavior/Results

## Summary

`InterestRateModel.sol` uses forced type casting, such as `expWad().toUint256()` and `(v.fixedFactor * 1e18).sqrt().toInt256()` . Forced type casting does not revert on overflow or underflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.

## Vulnerability Detail

The lines below are in `InterestRateModel.sol`:
```javascript 
    uint256 sigmoid = x > EXP_THRESHOLD ? 0 : uint256(1e18).divWadDown(1e18 + x.expWad().toUint256());
```
```javascript 
            ((v.natPools * (v.fixedFactor * 1e18).sqrt().toInt256()) /
```

## Impact

Forced type casting without proper overflow checks can result in unintended behavior and incorrect calculations. If the values being casted exceed the maximum or minimum limits of the target type, the result will silently overflow or underflow, leading to incorrect values being used in subsequent calculations. This can potentially lead to financial losses or other undesired consequences.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Avoid a forced type casting as much as possible and ensure values are in the range of type limit. 

2. Use safe casting techniques, such as the SafeCast library from OpenZeppelin, which provides functions that revert on overflow or underflow. Replace the forced type casting operations with safe alternatives
