# Absence of minAssets slippage protection can cause liquidators to be maliciously pushed to make unprofitable liquidations

## Summary
Since there is no minAssets he is expecting to receive from a liquidation, Liquidator can get frontrun by another liquidator, which would cause the seizedAssets received by the victim liquidator to be less than the gas fees he spent for that liquidation

## Vulnerability Detail
A liquidation can leave a position liquidatable(although healthier).
Liquidator is not allowed to specify minAssets or profit he is expecting from a liquidation. Therefore, the proceeds he gets from liquidating a position can be less than the cost he spent (e.g. gas fees) for that liquidation.
This will happen if he gets frontrunned by another (malicious) liquidator.

Consider the following scenario:

- average gas fees on network=$20, minCollateralRatio=150%
- Alice's position health is 120%, with collateral of $1200, debt of $1000
- LiquidatorA wants to repay $1000, seize $1100
    - profit=1100-1000-20=$80
- LiquidatorB frontruns LiquidatorA with a liquidation call that will leave the position slightly liquidatable, but the profit from the liquidation <$20
- LiquidatorA's transaction gets executed, but the liquidation profit <$20, resulting in a loss for him even though he was expecting profit of $80

## Impact
Liquidator can be pushed by a malicious liquidator to make an unprofitable liquidation.
