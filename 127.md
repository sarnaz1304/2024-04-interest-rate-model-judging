# A liquidator's TX of the Market#`liquidate()` will be reverted - due to lack of the `shares` in the form of ERC20 (that represents the borrower's collateral) to be burned via the Market#`_burn()`, which is invoked inside the Market#`internalSeize()`

## Summary
When a liquidator would call the  Market#`liquidate()`, a borrower to be liquidated is supposed to hold some amount of the shares in the form of ERC20 that represents the borrower's collateral - so that the liquidator can `burn` the shares in the form of ERC20 that represents the borrower's collateral and then the liquidator can seize the collateral asset of the borrower to be liquidated. 

However, within the Makert#`depositAtMaturity()` or the Market#`deposit()`, there is **no** logic (function) to mint the `shares` in the form of ERC20 that represents the depositor's collateral to the depositor via the Market#`_mint()`. 
Hence, when the depositor would borrow assets via the Market#`borrowAtMaturity()` or the Market#`borrow()` and become a borrower, the borrower does **not** hold any shares-minted in the form of ERC20 that represents the borrower's collateral.

This lead to that a liquidator's TX of the Market#`liquidate()` will be reverted - due to lack of the `shares` in the form of ERC20 (that represents the borrower's collateral) to be burned via the Market#`_burn()`, which is invoked inside the Market#`internalSeize()`.
(NOTE：The Market#`internalSeize()` would be called via the Market#`liquidate()`)  


## Vulnerability Detail

When a liquidator would like to liquidate a borrower's debt position, the liquidator would call the Market#`liquidate()` with a given `borrower` to be liquidated and a given `seizeMarket`.

Within the Market#`liquidate()`, the Market#`internalSeize()` would be invoked directly or invoked via the Market#`seizeMarket()` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L602
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L604
```solidity
  function liquidate(
    address borrower,
    uint256 maxAssets,
    Market seizeMarket
  ) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 repaidAssets) {
    ...

    if (address(seizeMarket) == address(this)) {
      internalSeize(this, msg.sender, borrower, seizeAssets); ///<----------- @audit
    } else { 
      seizeMarket.seize(msg.sender, borrower, seizeAssets); ///<----------- @audit 
      ...
    }
```

Within the Market#`internalSeize()`, the Market#`_burn()` would be invoked to burn the `shares` in the form of ERC20 from a given `borrower` to be liquidated like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L688
```solidity
  function internalSeize(Market seizeMarket, address liquidator, address borrower, uint256 assets) internal {
    if (assets == 0) revert ZeroWithdraw();

    // reverts on failure
    auditor.checkSeize(seizeMarket, this);

    RewardsController memRewardsController = rewardsController;
    if (address(memRewardsController) != address(0)) memRewardsController.handleDeposit(borrower);
    uint256 shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
    beforeWithdraw(assets, shares);
    _burn(borrower, shares);                ///<------------------ @audit
``` 

Based on above, the `shares` of a given `borrower` to be burned in the Market#`internalSeize()` is supposed to be minted when the given `borrower` would call the Makert#`depositAtMaturity()` or the Market#`deposit()` to deposit their asset into the Market contract as a **collateral**.
And therefore, when a liquidator would call the  Market#`liquidate()`, a borrower to be liquidated is supposed to hold some amount of the shares in the form of ERC20 that represents the borrower's collateral - so that the liquidator can `burn` the shares in the form of ERC20 that represents the borrower's collateral and then the liquidator can seize the collateral asset of the borrower to be liquidated. 

However, within the Makert#`depositAtMaturity()` or the Market#`deposit()`, there is **no** logic (function) to mint the `shares` in the form of ERC20 that represents the depositor's collateral to the depositor via the Market#`_mint()`. 
Hence, when the depositor would borrow assets via the Market#`borrowAtMaturity()` or the Market#`borrow()` and become a borrower, the borrower does **not** hold any shares-minted in the form of ERC20 that represents the borrower's collateral.


## Impact

This lead to that a liquidator's TX of the Market#`liquidate()` will be reverted - due to lack of the `shares` in the form of ERC20 (that represents the borrower's collateral) to be burned via the Market#`_burn()`, which is invoked inside the Market#`internalSeize()`.
(NOTE：The Market#`internalSeize()` would be called via the Market#`liquidate()`)

## Tool used
- Manual Review


## Recommendation
Within the Makert#`depositAtMaturity()`, consider adding a logic (function) to mint the `shares` to the borrower via the Market#`_mint()`. 
```diff
  function depositAtMaturity(
    uint256 maturity,
    uint256 assets,
    uint256 minAssetsRequired,
    address receiver
  ) external whenNotPaused whenNotFrozen returns (uint256 positionAssets) {
    if (assets == 0) revert ZeroDeposit();
    ...
    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
+   _mint(msg.sender, previewDeposit(assets));
  }
```

Likewise, within the Makert#`deposit()`, consider adding a logic (function) to mint the `shares` to the borrower via the Market#`_mint()`.
