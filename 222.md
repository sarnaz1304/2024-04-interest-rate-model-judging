# Lack of the implementation of the Market#`deposit()` in the Market contract, which lead to that the TX of the MarketETHRouter#`deposit()` would **always** be reverted

## Summary

Within the MarketETHRouter#`deposit()`, the Market#`deposit()` would be called to deposit WETH into the floating pool's market.

So, within the Market contract, the Market#`deposit()` is supposed to be implemented.

owever, within the Market contract, there is **no** implementation of the Market#`deposit()`. 
Hence, this lead to that the TX of the MarketETHRouter#`deposit()` would **always** be reverted.


## Vulnerability Detail

Within the MarketETHRouter#`deposit()`, the Market#`deposit()` would be called to deposit WETH into the floating pool's market like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/MarketETHRouter.sol#L51
```solidity
  /// @notice Wraps ETH and deposits WETH into the floating pool's market.
  /// @return shares number of minted shares.
  function deposit() external payable wrap returns (uint256 shares) {
    return market.deposit(msg.value, msg.sender); ///<---------------------- @audit
  }
```
So, within the Market contract, the Market#`deposit()` is supposed to be implemented.

However, within the Market contract, there is **no** implementation of the Market#`deposit()`. 
Hence, this lead to that the TX of the MarketETHRouter#`deposit()` would **always** be reverted.


## Impact
This lead to that the TX of the MarketETHRouter#`deposit()` would **always** be reverted - when a user would call the MarketETHRouter#`deposit()`.

## Tool used
- Manual Review


## Recommendation
Within the Market contract, consider implementing the Market#`deposit()`.
