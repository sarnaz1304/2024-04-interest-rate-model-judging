# Use of `assert` for Input Validation in Constructor

## Summary
The contract uses assert statements within the constructor to validate input parameters, which is not recommended due to gas inefficiency and lack of error messaging.
## Vulnerability Detail
In Solidity, assert() is intended for checking conditions that should never fail unless there's a bug in the code. For input validation or conditions that can be affected by user inputs or external factors, it's best practice to use require() instead. This provides better gas efficiency because if a condition fails, any unused gas is refunded.
## Impact
If an assertion fails during contract deployment due to invalid parameters being passed by the deploying account (e.g., incorrect interest rate model parameters), all provided gas will be consumed without refund. Additionally, no specific error message will be returned making debugging more difficult.

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Recommendation
Replace all instances where assertions are used for parameter validation with require statements including descriptive revert messages:
```solidity
constructor(Parameters memory p) {
    require(p.minRate > 0,"minRate must be greater than zero");
    // ... other parameter checks using require...
    require(p.maxRate <= 15_000e16,"maxRate exceeds maximum allowed value");
    
     _parameters = p;
     growthSpeed = SafeCast.toInt256(p.growthSpeed);
     sigmoidSpeed = SafeCast.toInt256(p.sigmoidSpeed);
     spreadFactor = SafeCast.toInt256(p.spreadFactor);
     
   floatingCurveA =
        ((p.naturalrate.mulWadUp(uint256(((growthspeed * (1E18 - int256(P.NATURALUTILIZATION /2)).lnwad()) /1E18).expwad())
       )-P.MINRATE)*...;
       
   floatingcurveb=int266(P.MINRATE)-int266(floatingcurvea.divwaddown(P.MAXUTILIZATION));
   
   market=market_;
   
   fixedallocation=p.fixedallocation;
   
}
```
This change would ensure efficient use of gas upon failed deployment attempts and provide clear reasons why they failed.
