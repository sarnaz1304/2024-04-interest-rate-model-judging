# Risk of incorrect collateral valuation when Chainlink price outside of min/max range

## Summary
Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value, the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset.

This lets users buy cheaply and borrow against it disproportionately in Exactly markets.

## Vulnerability Detail

This would allow a user to buy the asset at a very cheap price on the open market, deposit it in Exactly and borrow another asset for an amount that shouldn't be possible based on real price.

Example:
TokenA has a minPrice of $1. The price of TokenA drops to $0.10. The aggregator still returns $1 allowing the user to borrow against TokenA as if it is $1 which is 10x it's actual value.

## Impact
Risk of bad debt in case of asset crashes, representing a loss of fund for the protocol.

327: 
328:     int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
329:     if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
330:     return uint256(price) * baseFactor;

Manual Review

## Recommendation
StableOracle contracts should check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:
