# No check for Optimisim sequencer down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Using Chainlink in L2 chains requires checking if the sequencer is down to prevent stale prices from looking like they're updated while it's not. The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `assetPrice` is used the get the the price of assets from chainlink price feeds, but there is no check that the sequencer is down
```solidity 
  function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    return uint256(price) * baseFactor;
  }
```
## Impact
Malicious actors can take advantage of stale prices

## Recommendation
Check if sequencer is down and use a backup oracle in this situation.
