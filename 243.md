# Failure to Call afterDeposit Function Upon Depositatmaturity

## Summary

The current implementation of the `depositatmaturity` function fails to call the `afterDeposit` function after completing the deposit process. This omission leads to state variables remaining unupdated and non-compliance with the ERC4626 standard, which could potentially introduce inconsistencies and undermine the integrity of the system.

## Vulnerability Detail


The vulnerability arises from the absence of a call to the `afterDeposit` function within the `deposit` function. According to the ERC4626 standard, this function should be invoked after completing the deposit process to update floating asset values and ensure consistency within the system. Failure to call `afterDeposit` leaves state variables unupdated, potentially causing discrepancies in asset values.

## Impact

This vulnerability undermines the integrity and reliability of the system, potentially leading to inaccuracies in asset values and affecting the overall functionality of the platform.
