# [M-6] `Deposit` & `Borrow` in `Market.sol` allows for Repeated Lending and Borrowing the same token within a single transaction, which enables Liquidity Manipulation and Interest Rate Manipulation

## Summary

The `Market.sol` contract's vulnerability, permitting repeated lending and borrowing of the same token in a single transaction, poses a significant risk, enabling malicious actors to manipulate interest rates and liquidity for a specific token. This dangerous exploit can result in the artificial inflation of liquidity, allowing attackers to borrow a substantial portion of the deposited amount, ultimately disrupting market dynamics and causing unpredictable interest rate fluctuations.

Run these tests with `forge test --mt testLiquidityManipulation` and `forge test --mt testInterestRateManipulation`

A walk-through of these tests:

The `testLiquidityManipulation` test does the following:

1. The attacker deposits a significant amount of WETH as collateral.
2. The initial liquidity of the WETH market is recorded.
3. The attacker repeatedly lends and borrows WETH within a single transaction, artificially inflating the liquidity.
4. The final liquidity is recorded and asserted to be greater than the initial liquidity, confirming the manipulation.


`testInterestRateManipulation` does the following:

1. The attacker deposits a significant amount of WETH as collateral.

2. The initial interest rate of the WETH market is recorded.

3.The attacker repeatedly lends and borrows WETH within a single transaction, artificially inflating the liquidity and borrowing a significant portion of the deposited amount.

4. The final interest rate is recorded and compared to the initial interest rate using assertApproxEqRel, confirming the manipulation.


## Impact

By exploiting the vulnerability in the `Market.sol` contract, an attacker can manipulate both liquidity and interest rates of a specific token. This can lead to distorted market conditions, enabling further exploits such as interest rate manipulation and price manipulation, resulting in financial losses for other users and destabilizing the protocol. Additionally, manipulating interest rates can cause borrowers to face higher rates and lenders to receive lower returns than expected, ultimately undermining user trust and the protocol's stability.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the `Market.sol` contract should implement measures to prevent repeated lending and borrowing within a single transaction. This can be achieved by:

1. Keeping track of the tokens that have been lent or borrowed within a transaction.
2. Disallowing further lending or borrowing of the same token within the same transaction.
3. Implementing a cooldown period between lending and borrowing operations for the same token.
