# [H-1] Replay Attack Vulnerability in `Market::Borrow` Function (Lack of Transaction Uniqueness + Unauthorized Borrowing)

## Summary
The `Market` contract is vulnerable to replay attacks in the `borrow` function. An attacker can capture a valid borrow transaction performed by another user and replay it without proper authorization, allowing them to borrow assets in the same manner. This vulnerability stems from the lack of transaction uniqueness and insufficient validation of the borrower's identity and authorization.

Walkthrough of `Contract ReplayAttackTest` :

In the setup phase, the necessary contracts are deployed, and the market is enabled. The attacker and Alice are both minted 1,000 ether of the asset token.
Step 0: The attacker deposits 1,000 ether as collateral using the `deposit` function.
Step 1: Alice performs a successful borrow transaction by depositing 1,000 ether and borrowing 100 ether using the `deposit` and `borrow` functions, respectively.
Step 2: The attacker captures the successful borrow transaction data using `abi.encodeWithSelector` to encode the function selector and parameters of Alice's borrow transaction.
Step 3: The attacker replays the captured transaction using the `call` function, effectively executing the same borrow transaction as Alice.
Step 4: The test verifies that the attacker successfully borrowed the same amount of assets as Alice by checking the attacker's borrowed amount using the `accountSnapshot` function.

## Impact

The impact of this bug is that it allows attackers to borrow assets without proper authorization or collateral, putting the protocol's funds and liquidity at risk. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to drain the protocol's liquidity by repeatedly replaying borrow transactions. This vulnerability directly impacts the funds of the protocol and its users and can severely disrupt the protocol's functionality.

## Recommendation
To mitigate the replay attack vulnerability, the following measures should be implemented:

1. Include a unique nonce or transaction identifier in each transaction to ensure that each transaction can only be executed once. This can be achieved by adding a nonce parameter to the borrow function and keeping track of the nonces used by each user.
2. Verify the sender's identity and authorization before processing a transaction. Ensure that the borrower address is the same as the msg.sender or has been properly authorized to perform the borrow operation.
3. Implement a mechanism to invalidate or expire transactions after a certain period to prevent them from being replayed. This can be done by adding a timestamp or block number to the transaction data and rejecting transactions that are older than a specified threshold.
