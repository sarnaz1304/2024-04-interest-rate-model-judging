# [M-8] `Market.sol`: Users can withdraw in the same transaction as deposit and can lead to flashloan-deposit-harvest-withdraw attack cycle.

## Summary
The `Market.sol` contract in the protocol allows users to withdraw their funds in the same transaction as their deposit. This lack of separation between deposit and withdrawal operations can lead to potential vulnerabilities and fund manipulation.

}
```
To run this test, run the command `forge test --mt testWithdrawInSameTransactionAsDeposit `

The test above, `testWithdrawInSameTransactionAsDeposit`, does the following
1.  Records BOB's initial balance using asset.balanceOf(BOB).
2. Approves the market to spend BOB's tokens for the deposit amount.
3. Deposits funds into the market on behalf of BOB using market.deposit(depositAmount, BOB).
4. Checks that the deposit was successful by asserting that BOB's balance in the asset token has decreased by the deposit amount and that BOB's balance in the market contract is equal to the deposit amount.
5. Withdraws the same amount of funds that were just deposited using market.withdraw(depositAmount, BOB, BOB) in the same transaction.
6.Checks that the withdrawal was successful by asserting that BOB's balance in the asset token is equal to the initial balance and that BOB's balance in the market contract is zero.

The test passes, indicating that the vulnerability allowing users to withdraw in the same transaction as deposit does indeed exists in the protocol.
## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability (allowing users to withdraw their funds in the same transaction as their deposit) is significant as it allows users to manipulate their balances and potentially exploit the protocol. By withdrawing funds immediately after depositing in the same transaction, users can use flashloans to artificially inflate their balances, earn extra rewards, manipulate market conditions or even manipulate interest rates. This vulnerability can lead to unfair advantages, disruption of protocol functionality, and loss of funds for other users.

Allowing withdrawals within the same block as other interactions may enable attackers to exploit flashloan vulnerabilities, especially allowing withdrawals within the same transaction as deposit.

## Code Snippet

The `deposit` function from the `ERC4626` interface which the Market contract inherits from:
```javascript
contract Market is Initializable, AccessControlUpgradeable, PausableUpgradeable, ERC4626 
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol?plain=1#L15

This is the `ERC4626` interface's `deposit` function:
https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC4626.sol?plain=1#L46-L58

The `withdraw` function can be found here:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended to enforce a separation between deposit and withdrawal operations. This can be achieved by implementing one or more of the following:

Introduce a minimum time delay between a deposit and a withdrawal. This prevents users from immediately withdrawing funds after depositing and ensures a certain level of commitment to the protocol.

Require separate transactions for deposits and withdrawals. This means that users would need to make a deposit transaction and then initiate a separate transaction to withdraw their funds, preventing manipulation within a single transaction.

Implement additional checks and validations in the withdraw function to ensure that the user has sufficient balance and that the withdrawal is legitimate. This can include verifying that the user's balance has been held in the protocol for a minimum period before allowing a withdrawal.

Consider updating the protocol's accounting and reward distribution mechanisms to be resilient against immediate withdrawals after deposits. This may involve using time-weighted average balances or implementing vesting periods for rewards.
