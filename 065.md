# Lack of `wrap` Modifier in `withdrawAtMaturity` Function in `Market.sol`

## Summary
The `withdrawAtMaturity` function in the `Market.sol` contract lacks the `wrap` modifier, leading to unexpected behavior where WETH is sent to the main market for calculations instead of being properly handled within the function.


## Vulnerability Detail

Unlike other functions in the contract that explicitly handle WETH wrapped ETH and unwrap them when necessary using the `unwrap` modifier, the `withdrawAtMaturity` function lacks this modifier. As a result, it sends WETH to the main market for calculations instead of properly handling it within the function, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or other unintended consequences.

## Impact

The absence of the `wrap` modifier in the `withdrawAtMaturity` function can result in unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities related to the handling of WETH. This may lead to inaccurate calculations or other issues when withdrawing assets at maturity. Code reference in the Withdraw function

Also referencing  function repayAtMaturity, it has the wrap modifier and still calls unwrapAndTransfer, meaning that unwrapAndTransfer doesn't offer the protection needed we should always wrap/unwrap before we calculate

other functions handles wrapping and unwrapping the way the should.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `withdrawAtMaturity` function in `Market.sol` to include the `unwrap` modifier, ensuring that WETH is properly handled and unwrapped before calculations are performed. This will help prevent unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities related to the handling of wrapped ETH within the function.
