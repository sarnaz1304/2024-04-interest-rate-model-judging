# Not Compling with ERC4626

## Summary
refer Details

## Vulnerability Detail
Contract Inheriting `ERC4626` as well as `PausableUpgradeable`

So according to `EIP 4626` functions like `maxDeposit`, `maxRedeem`, `maxWithdraw` returns
`MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if deposits are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.`

So when protocol in paused mode those should return `0` but a/c current implementation 
`maxDeposit` returns `type(uint256).max`
`maxRedeem` returns `balanceOf[owner]`
`maxWithdraw` returns `convertToAssets(balanceOf[owner])`

Also there are some token like `COMP` `UNI` which only transferable or approvable to max `type(uint96).max`, so `maxDeposit` should take those into considaration

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
On pause mode above 3 function `maxDeposit`, `maxRedeem`, `maxWithdraw` should return 0, and `maxDeposit` should compatible with token like UNI & COMP
