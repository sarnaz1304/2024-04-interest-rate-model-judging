# User can setup and steal from liquidator, by making him seize far less collateral than the debt he is repaying.

## Summary
Since `seizeAssets` is calculated as the minimum of `repaidAssets*liquidationIncentiveFactor` and `maxWithdraw(borrower)`, Liquidator can lose as `maxWithdraw` in a market can be very little(far less than what was repaid), especially if attacker frontruns the call with another liquidate call that reduces the collateral of the borrower in that market, while leaving the position liquidatable

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:

- minCollateralRatio=150%, liquidatorIncentive=9%, lenderIncentive=1%
- User's collateralRatio is 120%:
  - He has debt of $100, collateral of $120 in MarketA
  - He has debt of $100, collateral of $120 in MarketB
  - He has debt of $100, collateral of $120 in MarketC
- Liquidator wants to repay $100 in MarketA and seize $109 in MarketB
- User frontruns liquidator with a liquidate call that repays $50 in MarketC, seize $55 in MarketB

At this point, totalCollateral in MarketB=120-55=$65

- Liquidator's transaction gets executed, which would make him repay ~$100 in MarketA(as the position is still very unhealthy), and allow him to seize $65 of collateral. This is due to this line of code in `calculateSeize` function:

```solidity
seizeAssets = Math.min(
    baseAmount.mulDivUp(10 ** markets[seizeMarket].decimals, priceCollateral).mulWadUp(
    1e18 + memIncentive.liquidator + memIncentive.lenders
    ),
    seizeMarket.maxWithdraw(borrower) //@audit-info you are only seizing fromm floatingPool?@audit-info can borrower frontrun?
);
```

Liquidator has lost 100-65=$35, when he was expecting to gain $9

## Impact

Through frontrunning, malicious user can make liquidator pay far more than what gets seized. This is theft of liquidator's funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing one of these:

- Allow liquidator to specify multiple markets to seize from
- Revert if repayAssets>seizedAssets to prevent liquidator from losing.
