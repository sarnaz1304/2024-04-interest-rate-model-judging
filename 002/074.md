# hanleBadDebt doesn't clear badDebt completely

## Summary
hanleBadDebt doesn't clear badDebt completely which can lead to accumulation of bad debt without being distributed between depositors leading to a scenario in which the protocol doesn't have enough funds to cover all withdrawals.
## Vulnerability Detail
If there is some amount of bad debt (debt without collateral), users can call handleBadDebt to clear bad debt, bad debt is repaid from earning accumulator ( additional protocol revenue ), however, if 'earningAccumulator' is not enough to cover bad debt it can't be cleared completely, in this case, to handle bad debt it's necessary to allow some time for the earnings accumulator to cover the losses sufficiently. however we can't rely on future earnings, earnings may not be as much as bad debt, also it's possible to have bad debt in the future, and it's important to clear bad debt since it's considered as part of market assets, while this amount is not available, leading to a scenario which if all users try to withdraw their assets in the pool, pool can't cover all withdrawals and users that exit later wouldn't be able to withdrawal. 

The following scenario describes the importance of clearing bad debt and the impact of not clearing it.
totalFloatingAssets has been used to calculate share prices at a variable rate pool, in a normal scenario floating debt is expected to be returned to the market so if the market doesn't have enough assets balance ( since some of the assets are being borrowed ) to cover the withdrawal and redeeming shares, users can wait for repayments to redeem shares and withdrawal assets from variable rate pool, but if there is any amount of bad debt ( debt without collateral ),  it's necessary to clear bad debt since this amount will not be returned to the market otherwise if all users try to withdrawal assets, protocol won't have enough assets to cover all withdrawals.

 Consider the following scenario : 
Variable rate market has the following state : totalFloatingAssets: 200 - floatingDebt: 100 - total supply ( variable rate pool shares ): 200 - Bad Debt: 50.
1 - User A redeems 100 shares and receives 100 assets 
2 - After repaying 50 debt by a borrower User B redeems 50 shares and receives 50 assets 
3 - Now there are no assets in the pool so the remaining users that hold 50 shares in the pool can't withdraw their assets
 since 50 amount of the debt can't be liquidated ( since it's bad debt ) there won't be enough assets to cover the remaining withdrawals, despite that the asset/share ratio is 1:1 but there is no asset to cover the withdrawal of remaining users so there is no assets for other users.
all the debt is forced to the last users instead of being distributed between users. 
## Impact
If all users try to withdraw their assets, there are not enough assets to cover all withdrawals

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the bad debt is higher than the earningAccumulator, decrease the remaining bad debt from floating assets or fixed pool deposits ( if bad debt is from fixed pool borrower ), indicating loss for depositors.
