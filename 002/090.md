# Possible Dos in Market::liquidate() because of insufficient earningsAccumulator

## Summary
Liquidate() may be reverted if there is not enough `earningsAccumulator` to absorb bad debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the borrower's position is not healthy enough, liquidator can liquidate their borrow position via Market::liquidate(). In the process of liquidation, if all collaterals from the borrower is liquidated, contract will clear the bad debt. The way to clear the bad debt is to try to use `earningsAccumulator` to cover the system's bad debt.
The vulnerability is that the liquidation process will be reverted if any market's `earningsAccumulator` cannot cover the related debt part. This is quite probable when the system launch for a short time, or there is one inactive market.
If some borrow positions can not be liquidated as expected, the system will have to take more risks.

```c
  function liquidate(
    address borrower,
    uint256 maxAssets,
    Market seizeMarket
  ) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 repaidAssets) {
    if (msg.sender == borrower) revert SelfLiquidation();

    maxAssets = auditor.checkLiquidation(this, seizeMarket, borrower, maxAssets);
    if (maxAssets == 0) revert ZeroRepay();

    Account storage account = accounts[borrower];
    ......

    emit Liquidate(msg.sender, borrower, repaidAssets, lendersAssets, seizeMarket, seizeAssets);
    @==> auditor.handleBadDebt(borrower);

    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), repaidAssets + lendersAssets);
  }

  function handleBadDebt(address account) external {
    ......
    marketMap = memMarketMap;
    for (uint256 i = 0; marketMap != 0; marketMap >>= 1) {
      if (marketMap & 1 != 0) marketList[i].clearBadDebt(account);
      unchecked {
        ++i;
      }
    }
  }
    function clearBadDebt(address borrower) external {
    ......
    if (totalBadDebt != 0) {
      earningsAccumulator -= totalBadDebt;
      emit SpreadBadDebt(borrower, totalBadDebt);
    }
    emitMarketUpdate();
  }
```

## Impact
Some borrow positions cannot be liquidated normally, which could cause some system risk.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure the liquidation process can be executed successfully. If there're some bad debt `earningsAccumulator` cannot cover, the treasury or the whole ecosystem(including lender, borrowers) should take the loss.
