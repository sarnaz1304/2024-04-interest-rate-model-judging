# Malicious users can open many small positions and borrow debt, liquidators has no profit to liquidate such positions

## Summary

Malicious users can open many small positions and borrow debt, liquidators has no profit to liquidate such positions

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol have no limitation to minimum borrowable token currently, so any users can open many small positions and borrow debt. This protocol can be deployed on multiple chains including Ethernum, means the gas fee for liquidating the position maybe higher than the liquidation incentive, such that the positions maybe never be liquidated because liquidators won't be able to gain profits from the liquidation.


## Impact

Many positions can't be liquidated cause protocol bad debt.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Protocol should have minimum borrow debt amount limitation to make liquidators have enough incentive to liquidate any user's position.
