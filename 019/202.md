# User can open borrow positions that would cause liquidators to be disincentivized from liquidating it due to gas fees

## Summary
Opening borrow positions with collateral less than average gas fees on that network, would disincentivize liquidators from liquidating it.
Attacker can open many of these positions with multiple accounts, which is equivalent to a large borrow position.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no minimum borrow position that a user is required to open. User can open positions backed by `<gasfees` collateral, and if it gets liquidatable, liquidators won't want to liquidate it which could lead to insolvency.

In addition, user can deposit `<gasFees` collateral in each of the markets, and borrow up to `gasFees`\*numberOfMarkets/collateralRatio. Since liquidators have to specify the market to seize from, and user collateral in each market is `<gasFees`, seizing from any of the markets would result in loss for the liquidator.

Note that protocol will be deployed on ethereum mainnet, where gas fees are very high.

## Impact
Since liquidating tiny unhealthy positions would result in loss for liquidator. Liquidators won't want to liquidate them, leading to accrual of bad debt->insolvency

## Recommendation
borrow,borrowAtMaturity,withdraw,withdrawAtMaturity should enforce a minimum amount of borrow positions that should be opened.
