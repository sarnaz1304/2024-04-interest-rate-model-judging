# Risks associated with Upgradable escrow contract

## Summary
The `EscrowedEXA` contract is upgradable which poses certain risks to user 

## Vulnerability Detail

The upgradable nature of the escrow contract poses a considerable risk to users who approve their Tokens to interact with the contract. Unlike conventional token exchanges, where user assets aren't required to be approved for admin-controlled upgradability, this setup introduces substantial risks.

```solidity
contract EscrowedEXA is ERC20VotesUpgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable {

```

## Impact

Users face potential hazards as their NFTs could be subjected to changes beyond their control due to the upgradable nature of the contract. Moreover, the requirement for users to approve their assets to the contract amplifies gas usage, as users must subsequently revoke approval once their interaction with the protocol concludes.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerability can be observed directly within the `EscrowedEXA` contract, where the upgradability feature is present, allowing for potential alterations to contract functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would suggest to discuss upgradbility concerns internally with the team and might make it non-upgradable with a restricted set of functionality.
