# [M-14] Lack of Cooling Period for Critical Protocol Changes (User Disruption)

## Summary

`Market.sol`, `RewardsController.sol`, `Auditor.sol`, and `EscrowedEXA.sol` allow the admin (contract owner or authorized roles) to change critical protocol properties immediately without any cooling period. This means that changes to important parameters, such as interest rates, adjust factors, price feeds, or reward distribution parameters, can be made instantly without giving users sufficient time to react or adjust their positions.

Changes in the critical protocol properties MUST go through a cooling period to allow users react on the changes.	

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability stems from the absence of a cooling period mechanism for functions that modify critical protocol properties. Without a cooling period, the admin can make changes to these properties instantly, without any delay or notice to the users. This immediate execution of changes can catch users off-guard and disrupt their strategies or financial plans.


## Impact

The absence of a cooling period for critical protocol changes can have a significant impact on users. Sudden changes to important parameters can catch users off-guard and disrupt their strategies or financial plans. For example:

If the admin suddenly increases interest rates, borrowers may face higher borrowing costs without having the opportunity to adjust their positions or repay their loans in advance.
If the admin modifies liquidation incentives, users may be exposed to unexpected liquidations or changes in the risk profile of their positions.
If the admin alters reward distribution parameters, users may miss out on potential rewards or experience a sudden change in the incentive structure.

The lack of a cooling period can lead to financial losses, unexpected consequences, and a loss of trust in the protocol. Users may feel that their funds are at risk if the protocol can be altered without prior notice or a reasonable time frame to react.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, I recommended to implement a cooling period for critical protocol changes. A cooling period is a time delay between the announcement of a proposed change and its actual execution. This delay provides users with sufficient notice and time to react to the proposed changes and make necessary adjustments.
