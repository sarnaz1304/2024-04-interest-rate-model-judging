# Protocol lossing some part of `fee` due to wrong rounding direction

## Summary
Refer Details

## Vulnerability Detail
In `DeFi` its an standard that rounding should always favour in direction( side ) of Protocol

In function `depositAtMaturity()` its not working as above

```solidity
  function depositAtMaturity(
    uint256 maturity,
    uint256 assets,
    uint256 minAssetsRequired,
    address receiver
  ) external whenNotPaused whenNotFrozen returns (uint256 positionAssets) {
...
...

    (uint256 fee, uint256 backupFee) = pool.calculateDeposit(assets, backupFeeRate);
    positionAssets = assets + fee;
    if (positionAssets < minAssetsRequired) revert Disagreement();

...
...
```
in which `pool.calculateDeposit()` called which return `(uint256 yield, uint256 backupFee)`
Where yeild ::= `amount to be offered to the fixed pool supplier.`
           backupFee ::= `yield to be accrued by the backup supplier for initially providing the liquidity`

```solidity
  function calculateDeposit(
    Pool memory pool,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 backupFeeRate
  ) internal pure returns (uint256 yield, uint256 backupFee) {
    uint256 memBackupSupplied = backupSupplied(pool);
    if (memBackupSupplied != 0) {
      yield = pool.unassignedEarnings.mulDivDown(Math.min(amount, memBackupSupplied), memBackupSupplied);
      backupFee = yield.mulWadDown(backupFeeRate); // @audit-issue
      yield -= backupFee;
    }
  }
```
Here we clearly see that calculation for `backupFee` is `Rounding Down` so it work against the Protocol as fee is collected from caller.


There is a later check in `depositAtMaturity()` 
```solidity
    positionAssets = assets + fee;
    if (positionAssets < minAssetsRequired) revert Disagreement();
```
Where `minAssetsRequired` ensure that `minAssetsRequired minimum amount of assets required by the depositor for the transaction to be accepted` where we see fee which calculated above are taken into consideration.

So user able to pay less, due to above rounding down

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always fee calculation shoud be in favour of protocol. Its an standard.
So calculation of `backupFee` in `calculateDeposit()` function should be `Rounding Up` rather than `Rounding Down`
