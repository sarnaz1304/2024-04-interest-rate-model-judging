# Improper use of `assert` in `InstallmentsRouter::borrow`

## Summary
Assert statements are generally used to check for non-zero borrow amounts. `assert` is generally used for invariant checking and not for input validation because it consumes all gas available when it fails.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `InstallmentsRouter::borrow`, there is incorrect use of an `assert` statement instead of a `require` statement as is common for input validation.

## Impact
In case of failure, all available gas is consumed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace `assert` with `require` for input validation. This change saves gas and is more semantically appropriate, because require is intended for conditions that can depend on external input

```diff
-assert(amounts.length > 1);
+require(amounts.length > 1, "desired error message");
```
