# Liquidations does not consider the overall health of the protocol

## Summary
The liquidation mechanism design does not prioritize liquidating the unhealthiest debt position first. Hence there will be liquidations that will make the overall protocol health worse than before. During market crashes, the protocol can be "intentionally" or "accidentally" be placed in an insolvent state because of that.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's illustrate the scenario.
- On a normal market (low volatility) condition, Alice, Bob, Carl, Daisy borrows and logs the following debt positions in the OP Mainnet:
    - Alice borrows 20,000 USDC with 10 WETH as collateral
    - Bob borrows 15,000 USDC with 0.5 WBTC as collateral
    - Carl borrows 3,250 USDC with 10,000 OP as collateral

- And the exchange rates are as follows:
    - 1 eth = 3,100 usdc
    - 1 btc = 62,000 usdc
    - 1 op = 3.1 usdc

- Let's calculate the health factor of each individual position based on the risk factor. 
    - `REFERENCE`
        - Health Factor: https://docs.exact.ly/guides/liquidations#health-factor 
        - Risk Factor: https://docs.exact.ly/guides/parameters#d.-risk-factors
    - `CALCULATION`
        - For Alice:
            - `risk_adjusted_collateral_in_usdc`: 10 weth * 3100 usdc per weth * 0.86 risk factor  = `26,660 usdc`
            - `risk_adjusted_debt`: 20,000 usdc / 0.86 risk factor = `23,256 usdc`
            - `health_factor`: risk_adjusted_collateral / risk_adjusted_collateral_debt = 26,660 usdc / 23,256 usdc = `1.15`
        - For Bob: 
            - `risk_adjusted_collateral_in_usdc`: 0.5 wbtc * 62,000 usdc per wbtc * 0.78 risk factor  = `24,180 usdc`
            - `risk_adjusted_debt`: 15,000 usdc / 0.78 risk factor = `19,231 usdc`
            - `health_factor`: risk_adjusted_collateral / risk_adjusted_collateral_debt = 24,180 usdc / 19,231 usdc = `1.26`
        
        - For Carl:
            - `risk_adjusted_collateral_in_usdc`: 10,000 op * 3.1 usdc per op * 0.35 risk factor  = `10,085 usdc`
            - `risk_adjusted_debt`: 3,250 usdc / 0.35 risk factor = `9,286 usdc`
            - `health_factor`: risk_adjusted_collateral / risk_adjusted_collateral_debt = 10,085 usdc / 9,286 usdc = `1.17`
        
        - Now this is the summary of their positions: 
            | Name  | Collateral | Borrowed | Risk Factor | Health
            | :---- | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
            | Alice | 10 WETH  | 20,000 USDC | 0.86 | 1.15
            | Bob   | 0.5 WBTC | 15,000 USDC | 0.78 | 1.26
            | Carl  | 10,000 OP | 3,250 USDC | 0.35 | 1.17
        
        - The overall health of the protocol at this point is (1.15 + 1.26 + 1.17) / 3 = `1.19`. Note that for simplicity, the collateral value per market (WETH, WBTC, OP) is weighted the same where each market (WETH, WBTC, OP) is equivalent to 33.33% of the overall collateral. 
        
        - Take note that according to the [docs](https://docs.exact.ly/guides/liquidations#health-factor), anything below 1 is considered a shortfall and since this is `above 1`, then it's healthy at this point.

- Suddenly the market tanked faster than the liquidators can catch (which is very much plausible). The prices dropped:
    - ETH dropped from 3,100 USDC to 2,600 USDC
    - WBTC dropped from 62,000 USDC to 48,000 USDC
    - OP dropped from 3.1 USDC to 2 USDC 

- Following the calculation previously, the summary of debt positions is now like this:
    - Summary of individual positions now that the market has tanked: 
        | Name  | Collateral | Borrowed | Risk Factor | Health
        | :---- | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
        | Alice | 10 WETH  | 20,000 USDC | 0.86 | `0.96`
        | Bob   | 0.5 WBTC | 15,000 USDC | 0.78 | `0.97`
        | Carl  | 10,000 OP | 3,250 USDC | 0.35 | `0.75`
    - The overall health of the protocol = (0.96 + 0.97 + 0.75) / 3 = `0.90`. It's now unhealthy since it is below `1`.

- At this point, the liquidator chooses to liquidate Bob's position. Bob's position has been taken out of the system. Now the system looks like this: 
    - Summary of individual positions now that Bob's been liquidated:
        | Name  | Collateral | Borrowed | Risk Factor | Health
        | :---- | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
        | Alice | 10 WETH  | 20,000 USDC | 0.86 | `0.96`
        | Carl  | 10,000 OP | 3,250 USDC | 0.35 | `0.75`
    - The overall health of the protocol: (0.96 + 0.75) / 2 = `0.86`. The overall health of the protocol got worse from `0.90` to `0.86`

- Now let's say the liquidator chooses to liquidate the position of Carl (the worst health position) instead of Bob's. This is what's going to happen to the system:
    - Summary of individual position now that Carl is liquidated:
        | Name  | Collateral | Borrowed | Risk Factor | Health
        | :---- | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
        | Alice | 10 WETH  | 20,000 USDC | 0.86 | `0.96`
        | Bob   | 0.5 WBTC | 15,000 USDC | 0.78 | `0.97`
    - The overall health of the protocol: (0.96 + 0.97) / 2 = `0.965`. The overall health of the protocol got better from `0.90` to `0.965` (getting closer to 1).

In summary, we've shown that by prioritizing liquidations (by starting on the unhealthiest debt position), it will make the overall system health better. On the contrary, liquidating the healthiest (among the unhealthy) prior to the unhealthier ones will make the overall system health worse. It is clear that there should be liquidation prioritization mechanism here. 

## Impact
During market crashes, there will be situations where the asset prices falls faster than the liquidators can catch. Without liquidation prioritization, the `unhealthy` state of the whole system is prolonged and the protocol is at risk of insolvency.

## Recommendation
Create a liquidation mechanism where the liquidators will be compelled to liquidate the unhealthiest debt position first either by giving them incentives or convenience.
