# `Auditor::exitMarket` will revert for legit users who has zero debt & collateral

## Summary
A user with zero debt & collateral will not be able to `exit market` because `checkShortfall` will always fail

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the exitMarket` & `checkShortfall` functions. It arises from the failure of the `checkShortfall` method to include proper checks for scenarios where the account has zero outstanding debt & collateral in the market. This implementation results in transaction reverts when exiting markets.

### Exploit Scenario:

1. **User Attempts to Exit Market:** Alice wants to exit a market where she has no outstanding debt or collateral.
2. **Execution of `exitMarket` Function:** Alice initiates the `exitMarket` function to exit the market.
3. **Call to `checkShortfall`:** Inside the `exitMarket` function, `checkShortfall` is invoked to verify Alice's collateral adequacy to cover her debt in the market.
4. **Incorrect Revert:** Despite having no outstanding debt or collateral in the market, the current `checkShortfall` implementation causes an unnecessary transaction revert.
5. **Issue Impact:** Alice encounters difficulties exiting the market, leading to frustration and a compromised user experience.


```solidity

function checkShortfall(Market market, address account, uint256 amount) public view {
    // if the account is not 'in' the market, bypass the liquidity check
    if ((accountMarkets[account] & (1 << markets[market].index)) == 0) return;

    // otherwise, perform a hypothetical liquidity check to guard against shortfall
    (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = accountLiquidity(account, market, amount);
    if (collateral < debt) revert InsufficientAccountLiquidity();
}

```

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it prevents users from smoothly exiting markets where they have no outstanding debt or collateral. This undermines the usability of the Auditor contract and may lead to decreased user confidence in the platform.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L179-L186

```solidity
function checkShortfall(Market market, address account, uint256 amount) public view {
    // if the account is not 'in' the market, bypass the liquidity check
    if ((accountMarkets[account] & (1 << markets[market].index)) == 0) return;

    // otherwise, perform a hypothetical liquidity check to guard against shortfall
    (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = accountLiquidity(account, market, amount);
    if (collateral < debt) revert InsufficientAccountLiquidity();
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to update the `checkShortfall` function to include checks for scenarios where the account has no outstanding debt or collateral in the market. Additional conditions should be added to ensure that transactions only revert when necessary, improving the usability and reliability of the Auditor contract.


```solidity

function checkShortfall(Market market, address account, uint256 amount) public view {
    // Check if the account is 'in' the market
    if ((accountMarkets[account] & (1 << markets[market].index)) == 0) {
        // Account is not in the market, so liquidity check is not needed
        return;
    }

    // Check if the account has any collateral or debt in the market
    (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = accountLiquidity(account, market, amount);
    if (collateral == 0 && debt == 0) {
        // Account has no collateral or debt in the market, so liquidity check is not needed
        return;
    }

    // Perform a hypothetical liquidity check to guard against shortfall
    if (collateral < debt) {
        revert InsufficientAccountLiquidity();
    }
}

```
### Scenario (After Update):
1. **User Attempts to Exit Market:** Alice decides to exit a market where she has no outstanding debt or collateral.
2. **Execution of `exitMarket` Function:** Alice calls the `exitMarket` function to exit the market.
3. **Call to `checkShortfall`:** Within the `exitMarket` function, `checkShortfall` is invoked to ensure Alice has enough collateral to cover her debt in the market.
4. **Proper Handling:** With the updated `checkShortfall` function, Alice's exit from the market proceeds smoothly as the liquidity check correctly identifies her lack of obligations in the market.
5. **Enhanced User Experience:** Alice can now exit the market without encountering unnecessary obstacles, leading to an improved user experience and bolstered trust in the system.
