# Access Control on Initialization (Improper Access Restriction Leading to Unauthorized Contract Initialization)

## Summary
The initialize function is intended to be called once, but due to missing access control checks, it can be invoked by any user multiple times. This could lead to resetting the contract state and unauthorized use.
## Vulnerability Detail
The initialize method lacks a modifier or require statement that restricts its execution only to authorized users (e.g., contract deployer or owner). As a result, any external actor can call this function.
## Impact
If exploited, an attacker could re-initialize the contract's state variables at will. This may disrupt the normal operation of the smart contract and potentially allow for other attack vectors depending on how these variables are used throughout the system.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used
- Manual Review
## Recommendation
Implement role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl module:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";

// Inherit OwnableUpgradeable for ownership management 
contract Market is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable ...

// Ensure onlyOwner modifier usage within initialize function 
function initialize(...) external initializer onlyOwner {
   ...
}
This ensures that after deploying and initializing through a proxy pattern typically associated with upgradeability patterns like UUPS etc., further calls will revert unless sent by owner account thus mitigating risk unauthorized initializations post deployment phase effectively protecting against such high severity risks identified above .
