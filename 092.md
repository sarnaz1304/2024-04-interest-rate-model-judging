# Unhandled chainlink revert would lock all price oracle access

## Summary

In some extreme cases, oracles can be taken offline or token prices can fall to zero. In these cases, liquidations will be frozen (all calls will revert) for any debt holders holding tokens, even though they may be some of the most important times to allow liquidations to retain the solvency of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink’s multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will. Therefore, to prevent denial of service scenarios, it is recommended to query Chainlink price feeds using a defensive approach with Solidity’s `try/catch ` structure. In this way, if the call to the price feed fails, the caller contract is still in control and can handle any errors safely and explicitly.

Refer to https://blog.openzeppelin.com/secure-smart-contract-guidelines-the-dangers-of-price-oracles/ for more information regarding potential risks to account for when relying on external price feed providers.

When this occurs, executing `priceFeed.latestAnswer();` will revert, causing the `assetPrice` function to also revert. This results in a denial of service when calling functions such as `accountLiquidity`, `checkLiquidation`, `calculateSeize`, and `handleBadDebt`. These functions are integral to the core functionalities of the protocol. With these functionalities susceptible to denial of service attacks, the protocol's usability becomes severely limited.

`Note: We know that Chainlink is trusted, but they have placed this responsibility on developers' shoulders to handle the implementation correctly.`

## Impact

Liquidations may not be possible at a time when the protocol needs them most. As a result, the value of user's asset may fall below their debts, turning off any liquidation incentive and pushing the protocol into insolvency.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Below is a snippet of code where the price feed’s latestRoundData function is queried. Instead of calling it directly, we surround it with `try/catch`. In a scenario where the call reverts, the catch block can be used to explicitly revert, call a fallback oracle, or handle the error in any way suitable for the contract’s logic.

```solidity
function getPrice(address priceFeedAddress) external view returns (int256) {
    try priceFeedAddress.latestAnswer() returns (int256 price) {
        return price;
    } catch Error(string memory) {            
        // handle failure here:
        // revert, call propietary fallback oracle, fetch from another 3rd-party oracle, etc.
    }
}
```
